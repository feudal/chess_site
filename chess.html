          <h2><a name="pref01"></a>TRANSLATOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h2>
          <p>
            As the first edition of Edward Lasker&rsquo;s <i>Chess Strategy</i> was
            exhausted within a comparatively short time of its appearance, the author set
            himself the task of altering and improving the work to such an extent that it
            became to all intents and purposes a new book. I had the privilege of
            co-operating with him to a slight degree on that second edition, and was in
            consequence able to appreciate the tremendous amount of work he voluntarily
            took upon himself to do; I say voluntarily, because his publishers, anxious to
            supply the strong demand for the book, wished to reprint it as it stood.
          </p>
          <p>
            A little later I undertook to translate this second edition into English for
            Messrs. Bell &amp; Sons. Only a few months had elapsed, the tournaments at
            Petrograd, Chester, and Mannheim had taken place, several new discoveries had
            been made, and it is the greatest testimony to Edward Lasker&rsquo;s
            indefatigable devotion to the Art of Chess that I am able to say that this is
            not a translation of the second edition, but of what is practically a new book.
            It contains a new preface, a chapter for beginners, a new introduction, new
            variations. Furthermore, a large number of new games have taken the place of
            old ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have no doubt that any chess player who will take the trouble to study
            <i>Chess Strategy</i> will spend many a pleasurable hour. Incidentally new
            vistas will be opened to him, and his playing strength increased to a
            surprising degree.
          </p>
          <p>The author says in his preface that he appeals to the
            intelligence and not the memory of his readers. In my opinion,
            too, the student should above all try to improve his judgment of
            position.</p>
          <p>Than the playing over of games contested by experts I can hardly
            imagine a greater or purer form of enjoyment. Yet I must at the
            outset sound a note of warning against its being done
            superficially, and with a feverish expectation of something
            happening. Every move or combination of moves should be carefully
            weighed, and the student should draw his own conclusions and
            compare them with what actually happens in the game under
            examination.</p>
          <p>This applies particularly to some of the critical positions set
            out in diagrams in the course of the exposition of the several
            games.</p>
          <p>The reader would derive the greatest possible benefit from a
            prolonged study of such positions before seeking to know how the
            games proceed. After having formed his own opinion about the
            merits of a particular position, he should compare the result
            with the sequel in the game in question, and thus find out where
            his judgment has been at fault.</p>
          <p>The deeper study of the theory of the openings is of course a
            necessity to the student who wishes to become an expert, but the
            development of his judgment must precede it. To him Griffith &amp;
            White&rsquo;s admirable book, <i>Modern Chess Openings</i>, will be a perfect
            mine of information. There are thousands of variations, and in
            most of them the actual game in which they were first tried by
            masters is named, thus adding to the interest and value of the
            work.</p>
          <p>I must not omit to mention the invaluable help afforded me by my
            friend Mr. John Hart, to whom my warmest thanks are due.</p>

          <h2><a name="pref02"></a>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h2>
          <p>
            The large majority of chess players who would like to improve
            their game, have not the necessary opportunity of pitting
            themselves against players of master-strength, or at least of
            obtaining the desired instruction from personal intercourse with
            them. It is for such players that the present work is intended.
            The books on which the learner has to rely hardly ever serve his
            purpose, being mostly little more than a disjointed tabulation of
            numberless opening variations, which cannot be understood without
            preliminary studies, and consequently only make for confusion. In
            the end the connection between the various lines of play may
            become clear, after the student has made an exhaustive study of
            the subject, but very few would have either the time or the
            inclination for such prolonged labour.</p>
          <p>Therefore another shorter and less empirical way must be found in
            which to acquire the understanding of sound play. My system of
            teaching differs from the usual ones, in that it sets down at the
            outset definite elementary principles of chess strategy by which
            any move can be gauged at its true value, thus enabling the
            learner to form his own judgment as to the manœuvres under
            consideration. In my opinion it is absolutely <i>essential</i> to follow
            such strategical principles, and I go so far as to assert that
            such principles are in themselves <i>sufficient</i> for the development
            and conduct of a correct game of chess.</p>
          <p>Even though instruction in chess is possible on very general
            lines alone, yet I think it advisable and indeed necessary to
            explain the application of such principles to the various phases
            of each game of chess. Otherwise the learner might unduly delay
            his progress, and lose valuable time in finding out for himself
            certain essentials that could more profitably be pointed out to
            him.</p>
          <p>With regard to the way in which I have arranged my subject and
            the form of its exposition in detail, I have thought out the
            following plan.</p>
          <p>After discussing at length the leading principles underlying
            sound play, I have first treated of the <i>openings</i>, in which such
            principles are of even more deciding influence than in any other
            stage of the game, as far as could be done on broad lines without
            having to pay attention to middle and end-game considerations.</p>
          <p>I proceeded as follows, by taking as my starting-point the &ldquo;pawn
            skeleton&rdquo; which is formed in the opening, and round which the
            pieces should group themselves in logical fashion. As a
            consequence of the pawns having so little mobility, this &ldquo;pawn
            skeleton&rdquo; often preserves its shape right into the end-game.
            Applying the general strategical principles to the formation of
            the pawn skeleton, the learner acquires the understanding of the
            leading idea underlying each opening without having to burden his
            memory. Not only that, he will also be able to find a correct
            plan of development when confronted with unusual forms of
            opening.</p>
          <p>The most important result of this system of teaching is that the
            learner does not lose his way in a maze of detail, but has in
            view at the very outset, the goal which the many possible
            variations of the openings are intended to reach.</p>
          <p>
            Before I could proceed to the discussion of the middle game, I found it
            necessary to treat of the principles governing the <i>end-game</i>. For in most
            cases play in the middle game is influenced by end-game considerations. Here
            also it has been my endeavour as far as possible to reduce my subject to such
            principles as are generally applicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, as regards the <i>middle game</i>, to which the whole of Part II is
            devoted, I have again made the handling of pawns, the hardest of all problems
            of strategy, the starting-point for my deliberations. I have shown at length
            how the various plans initiated by the various openings should be developed
            further. To ensure a thorough understanding of the middle game, I have given a
            large number of games taken from master play, with numerous and extensive
            notes. Thus the student has not to rely only on examples taken haphazard from
            their context, but he will at the same time see how middle-game positions,
            which give opportunities for special forms of attack, are evolved from the
            opening.
          </p>
          <p>It has been my desire to make the subject easily understandable
            and at the same time entertaining, and to appeal less to the
            memory of my readers than to their common sense and intelligence.
            I hope in that way not to have strayed too far from the ideal I
            had in mind when writing this book, namely, to apply to chess the
            only method of teaching which has proved productive in all
            branches of science and art, that is, the education of individual
            thought.</p>
          <p>If I have succeeded in this, I shall have the satisfaction of
            having contributed a little to the furthering, in the wide
            circles in which it is played, of the game which undoubtedly
            makes the strongest appeal to the intellect.</p>

            INTRODUCTORY</h2>
          <h3><a name="sect1.1"></a>I. RULES OF THE GAME</h3>
          <p>A GAME of chess is played by two opponents on a square board
            consisting of sixty-four White and Black squares arranged
            alternately. The forces on each side comprise sixteen units,
            namely a King, a Queen, two Rooks, two Bishops, two Knights, and
            eight Pawns. All units move according to different laws, and the
            difference in their mobility is the criterion of their relative
            value and of the fighting power they contribute towards achieving
            the ultimate aim, namely, the capture of the opposing King.
            Before I can explain what is meant by the capture of the King, I
            must set out the rules of the game in full.</p>
          <p>Diagram 1 shows the position the forces take up for the contest.
            The board is so placed that there is a white square at the top
            left-hand corner. The Rooks take up their positions at the corner
            squares, and next to them the Knights. Next to those again are
            the Bishops, and in the centre the King and Queen, the White
            Queen on a White square, and the Black Queen on a Black square.
            The eight pawns occupy the ranks immediately in front of the
            pieces. From this initial position, White begins the game in
            which the players must move alternately.</p>
          <p>The pieces move in the following way: The Rook can move from any
            square it happens to be on, to any other square which it can
            reach in a straight line, either perpendicularly or horizontally,
            unless there is another piece of the same colour in the way, in
            which case it can only move as far as the square immediately in
            front of that piece. If it is an opposing piece which blocks the
            way, he can move on to the square that piece occupies, thereby
            capturing it. The piece thus captured is removed from the board.
            The Bishop can operate along either of the diagonals of which the
            square on which he is standing forms part. A Bishop on a White
            square can therefore never get on to a Black one.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag01.jpg" width="400" height="398" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 1</p>
          </div>
          <p>The Queen commands both the straight and the oblique lines which
            start from the square she stands on, and therefore unites the
            power of both Rook and Bishop in her movements.</p>
          <p>The King has similar powers to the Queen, but curtailed, inasmuch
            as he can only move one step at a time. He therefore only
            controls one neighbouring square in any direction.</p>
          <p>The Knight plays and captures alternately on White and Black
            squares, and only reaches such squares as are nearest to him
            without being immediately adjacent; his move is as it were
            composed of two steps, one square in a straight line, and one in
            an oblique direction. Diagram 2 will illustrate this.<a href="#fn1" name="fnref1" id="fnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
          <p class="footnote">
            <a name="fn1" id="fn1"></a> <a href="#fnref1">[1]</a>
            I should like to quote my friend Mr. John Hart&rsquo;s clever definition of the
            Knight&rsquo;s move, though it may not be new. If one conceives a Knight as
            standing on a corner square of a rectangle three squares by two, he is able to
            move into the corner diagonally opposite.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pawns only move straight forward, one square at a time, except at their
            first move, when they have the option of moving two squares. In contrast to the
            pieces, the pawns do not capture in the way they move. They move straight
            forward, but they capture diagonally to the right and left, again only one
            square, and only forward. Therefore a pawn can only capture such pieces or
            pawns as occupy squares of the same colour as the square on which it stands.
            If, in moving two squares, a pawn traverses a square on which it could have
            been captured by a hostile pawn, that pawn has the right to capture it, as if
            it had moved only one square. This is called capturing <i>en passant</i>.
            However, this capture can only be effected on the very next move, otherwise the
            privilege of capturing <i>en passant</i> is lost.
          </p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag02.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 2</p>
          </div>
          <p>If a player succeeds in reaching the eighth rank with one of his
            pawns he is entitled to call for any piece of higher grade, with
            the exception of the King, in place of such pawn.</p>
          <p>Each move in a game of chess consists of the displacement of one
            piece only, with the exception of what is termed &ldquo;castling,&rdquo; in
            which the King and either Rook can be moved simultaneously by
            either player once in a game. In castling, the King moves
            sideways to the next square but one, and the Rook to which the
            King is moved is placed on the square which the King has skipped
            over. Castling is only allowed if neither the King nor the Rook
            concerned have moved before, and if there is no piece between the
            Rook and King.</p>
          <p>Diagram 3 shows a position in which White has castled on the
            Queen&rsquo;s side, and Black on the King&rsquo;s side. Castling is not
            permitted if the King in castling must pass over a square
            attacked by a hostile piece. A square (or a piece) is said to be
            &ldquo;attacked&rdquo; when the square (or the piece) is in the line of
            action of a hostile unit. A square (or a piece) is said to be
            covered or protected if an opposing piece occupying that square
            (or capturing the piece) could itself be captured.</p>
          <p>When attacking the King it is customary to call &ldquo;check,&rdquo; to
            notify the opponent of the fact; for the attack on the King</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag03.jpg" width="400" height="399" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 3</p>
          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            must be met in some way or other. This can be done by capturing
            the attacker or by interposing a piece (this is not possible in
            case of attack by a Knight or a pawn), or lastly by moving the
            King to a square which is not attacked. The latter must not be
            done by castling. If it is impossible by any of the three methods
            above mentioned to avoid the attack upon the King, the King is
            said to be checkmated, and the game is ended.</p>
          <p>If a King is unable to move, though not attacked, and none of his
            remaining pieces can move, the King is said to be stale-mated,
            and the game is drawn. A game is also drawn when neither side has
            sufficient material left to enforce a mate. (Compare page 63.)</p>
          <p>If a player resigns his game before he is actually mated, he
            acknowledges that in the end mate is unavoidable, and the game is
            counted as a loss to him.</p>
          <p>A game is null and void if it is shown that a mistake was made in
            setting the board or men. The same applies when in the course of
            the game the position and number of pieces have been altered in a
            manner not in accordance with the proper course of play, and the
            latter cannot be re-constructed from the point where the error
            was made.</p>
          <p>If a player having the move touches one of his pieces he is under
            compulsion to move it; if he touches a hostile piece he must
            capture it, provided that the piece can be properly moved or
            captured in either case. This rule is of no effect if the piece
            so touched cannot be moved or captured, as the case may be. So
            long as the hand has not left the piece to be moved, the latter
            can be placed on any accessible square. If a player touches a
            piece with the sole object of adjusting its position, he must
            apprise his opponent of his intention by saying &ldquo;J&rsquo;adoube&rdquo;
            beforehand. It is best to move the King first when castling. If
            the Rook is moved first, and unless the King is played almost
            simultaneously, a doubt might arise whether castling or a Rook&rsquo;s
            move only was intended.</p>
          <p>If a player has castled illegally, Rook and King must be moved
            back, and the King must make another move, if there is a legal
            one. If not, any other move can be played. A player who makes an
            illegal move with a piece must retract that move, and make
            another one if possible with the same piece. If the mistake is
            only noticed later on, the game should be restarted from the
            position in which the error occurred.</p>
          <h3><a name="sect1.2"></a>II. NOTATION</h3>
          <p>
            A special notation has been adopted to make the study of games
            and positions possible, and it is necessary for students of the
            game to become thoroughly conversant with it. The original and
            earliest notation is still in use in English, French, and Spanish
            speaking countries. It is derived from the original position in
            the game, in that the squares take the names of the pieces which
            occupy them. Thus the corner squares are called R 1 (Rook&rsquo;s
            square or Rook&rsquo;s first), and to distinguish them from one another
            QR1 or KR 1 (Queen&rsquo;s or King&rsquo;s Rook&rsquo;s square). The squares
            immediately in front are called QR2 or KR2. A distinction is made
            between White and Black, and White&rsquo;s R 1 is Black&rsquo;s R 8, Black&rsquo;s
            R 2 is White&rsquo;s R 7, White&rsquo;s K B 3 is Black&rsquo;s KB6, and so on. K
            stands for King; Q for Queen; B for Bishop; Kt for Knight; R for
            Rook; and P for Pawn. In describing a capture, only the capturing
            and the captured pieces are mentioned, and not the squares.</p>
          <p>When confusion is possible, it is customary to add whether King&rsquo;s
            side or Queen&rsquo;s side pieces are concerned, e.g. KR×Q Kt. In
            this notation it is necessary to bear in mind which Kt is the Q
            Kt, which R is the KR. This becomes increasingly difficult as the
            game goes on and pieces change their places. Many sets of
            chessmen have one Rook and one Knight stamped with a special
            sign, to show they are King&rsquo;s side pieces. This is not necessary
            in the case of Bishops: a white KB is always on white squares, a
            white QB on black squares.</p>
          <p>A more modern notation is the algebraic notation, which has been
            adopted in most countries. It has the advantage of being
            unmistakably clear, and also more concise. Here the perpendicular
            lines of squares (called files) are named with the letters a-h,
            from left to right, always from the point of view of White, and
            the horizontal lines of squares (called ranks) with numbers 1-8
            as before, only with the distinction that the rank on which the
            White pieces stand is always called the first; thus the square we
            named White&rsquo;s QB2 or Black&rsquo;s QB7 is now called c2 in both cases.
            Black&rsquo;s QB2 (White&rsquo;s QB7) is always c7. In capturing, the square
            on which the capture takes place and not the piece captured is
            noted, for the sake of uniformity. In the case of pawn moves, the
            squares only are noted.</p>
          <p>O—O stands for castles on the King&rsquo;s side; O—O—O stands for
            castles on the Queen&rsquo;s side; : or × stands for captures; + for
            check.</p>
          <p>In the following opening moves, both notations are used for the
            purpose of comparison:</p>

            HINTS FOR BEGINNERS—ELEMENTARY COMBINATIONS</h2>
          <p>THE mental development of the chess player is a gradual struggle
            from a state of chaos to a clear conception of the game. The
            period required for such development largely depends upon the
            special gifts the learner may possess, but in the main the
            question of methods predominates. Most beginners do not trouble
            very much about any particular plan in their study of chess, but
            as soon as they have learnt the moves, rush into the turmoil of
            practical play. It is self-evident that their prospects under
            such conditions cannot be very bright. The play of a beginner is
            planless, because he has too many plans, and the capacity for
            subordinating all his combinations to one leading idea is non-
            existent. Yet it cannot be denied upon investigation that a
            certain kind of method is to be found in the play of all
            beginners, and seems to come to them quite naturally. At first
            the pawns are pushed forward frantically, because there is no
            appreciation of the power and value of the pieces. Conscious of
            the inferiority of the pawns, the beginner does not conclude that
            it must be advantageous to employ the greater power of the
            pieces, but is chiefly concerned with attacking the opposing
            pieces with his pawns in the hope of capturing them. His aim is
            not to develop his own forces, but to weaken those of his
            opponent. His combinations are made in the hope that his
            adversary may not see through them, nor does he trouble much
            about his opponent&rsquo;s intentions. When most of his pawns are gone,
            then only do his pieces get their chance. He has a great liking
            for the Queen and the Knight, the former because of her
            tremendous mobility, the latter on account of his peculiar step,
            which seems particularly adapted to take the enemy by surprise.
            When watching beginners you will frequently observe numberless
            moves by a peripatetic Queen, reckless incursions by a Knight
            into the enemy&rsquo;s camp, and when the other pieces join in the
            fray, combination follows combination in bewildering sequence and
            fantastic chaos. Captures of pieces are planned, mating nets are
            woven, perhaps with two pieces, against a King&rsquo;s position, where
            five pieces are available for defence. This unsteadiness in the
            first childish stages of development makes it very difficult for
            the beginner to get a general view of the board. Yet the
            surprises which each move brings afford him great enjoyment.</p>
          <p>A few dozen such games are by no means wasted. After certain
            particular dispositions of pieces have proved his undoing, the
            beginner will develop the perception of threats. He sees dangers
            one or two moves ahead, and thereby reaches the second stage in
            his development.</p>
          <p>His combinations will become more and more sound, he will learn
            to value his forces more correctly, and therefore to husband his
            pieces and even his pawns with greater care. In this second stage
            his strength will increase steadily, but, and this is the
            drawback, only as far as his power of combination is concerned.
            Unless a player be exceptionally gifted, he will only learn after
            years of practice, if at all, what may be termed &ldquo;positional
            play.&rdquo; For that, it is necessary to know how to open a game so as
            to lay the foundation for a favourable middle game, and how to
            treat a middle game, without losing sight of the possibilities of
            the end-game. It is hopeless to try to memorise the various
            openings which analysis have proved correct, for this empirical
            method fails as soon as the opponent swerves from the recognised
            lines of play. One must learn to recognise the characteristics of
            sound play. They apply to all and any position, and the
            underlying principles must be propounded in a manner generally
            applicable. And this brings me to the substance of my subject,
            round which I will endeavour to build up a system compatible with
            common sense and logic.</p>
          <p>Before I proceed to develop my theme, I shall set down a number
            of elementary rules which will facilitate the understanding of
            such simple combinations as occur at every step in chess.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>If we ignore the comparatively small proportion of games in which
            the mating of the opponent&rsquo;s King is accomplished on a full
            board, we can describe a normal, average game of chess in the
            following way. Both sides will employ their available forces more
            or less advantageously to execute attacking and defensive
            manœuvres which should gradually lead to exchanges. If one side
            or the other emerges from the conflict with some material gain,
            it will generally be possible to force a mate in the end-game,
            whilst if both sides have succeeded by careful play to preserve
            equality of material, a draw will generally ensue.</p>
          <p>It will be found a little later that a single pawn may suffice,
            with some few exceptions, to achieve a victory, and we shall
            adopt the following leading principle for all combinations, viz.
            loss of material must be avoided, even if only a pawn. It is a
            good habit to look upon every pawn as a prospective Queen. This
            has a sobering influence on premature and impetuous plans of
            attack.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, victory is often brought about by a timely
            sacrifice of material.</p>
          <p>But in such cases the sacrificing of material has its
            compensation in some particular advantage of position. As
            principles of position are difficult for beginners to grasp, I
            propose to defer their consideration for the present and to
            devote my attention first to such combinations as involve
            questions of material. Let us master a simple device that makes
            most combinations easy both for attack and defence. It amounts
            merely to a matter of elementary arithmetic, and if the beginner
            neglects it, he will soon be at a material disadvantage.</p>
          <p>Diagram 4 may serve as an example:</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag04.jpg" width="400" height="394" alt="[Illustration]" />

          <p class="noindent">
            It is Black&rsquo;s move, and we will suppose he wishes to play P-K4. A
            beginner will probably calculate thus: I push on my pawn, he
            takes with his pawn, my Knight takes, so does his, then my Bishop
            takes, and so on. This is quite wrong, and means waste of time
            and energy.</p>
          <p>When the beginner considers a third or fourth move in such a
            combination, he will already have forgotten which pieces he
            intended to play in the first moves. The calculation is perfectly
            simple upon the following lines: I play P-K4, then my pawn is
            attacked by a pawn and two Knights, a Bishop and two Rooks, six
            times in all. It is supported by a Bishop, two Knights, two Rooks
            and a Queen, six times in all. Therefore I can play P-K4,
            provided the six units captured at K4 are not of greater value
            than the six white units which are recaptured. In the present
            instance both sides lose a pawn, two Knights, two Rooks, and a
            Bishop, and there is no material loss. This established, he can
            embark on the advance of the KP without any fear.</p>
          <p>Therefore: in any combination which includes a number of
            exchanges on one square, all you have to do is to count the
            number of attacking and defending units, and to compare their
            relative values; the latter must never be forgotten. If Black
            were to play KtxP in the following position, because the pawn at
            K 5 is attacked three times, and only supported twice, it would
            be an obvious miscalculation, for the value of the defending
            pieces is smaller.<a href="#fn2" name="fnref2" id="fnref2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

            It is difficult to compare the relative value of the different pieces, as so
            much depends on the peculiarities of each position, but, generally speaking,
            minor pieces, Bishop and Knight, are reckoned as equal; the Rook as equal to a
            minor piece and one or two pawns (to have a Rook against a minor piece, is to
            be the &ldquo;exchange&rdquo; ahead). The Queen is equal to two Rooks or three
            minor pieces.

          <p>Chess would be an easy game if all combinations could be tested
            and probed exhaustively by the mathematical process just shown.
            But we shall find that the complications met with are extremely
            varied. To give the beginner an idea of this, I will mention a
            few of the more frequent examples. It will be seen that the
            calculation may be, and very frequently</p>

            example of this is found in Diagram 6; KtxP

            fails on account of R X B; this leaves the Knight unprotected,
            and White wins two pieces for his Rook. Neither can the Bishop
            capture on K5 because of R X Kt. leaving the Bishop unprotected,
            after which BxKt does not retrieve the situation because the Rook
            recaptures from B6.</p>
          <p>A second important case, in which our simple calculation is of no
            avail, occurs in a position where one of the defending pieces is
            forced away by a threat, the evasion of which is more important
            than the capture of the unit it defends. In Diagram 7, for
            instance, Black may not play KtxP, because White, by playing P-
            Q6, would force the Bishop to Kt4 or B1, to prevent the pawn from
            Queening and the Knight would be lost. A further example of the
            same type is given in Diagram 8. Here a peculiar mating threat,
            which occurs not</p>

            KB2 and unavailable for the protection of the B at BI.</p>
          <p>White wins as follows:</p>
          <p>1. KtxB, KtxKt; 2. RxKt, QxR; 3. Kt-B7ch, K-Kt1; 4. Kt-R6 double
            ch, K-R1; 5 Q-Kt8ch, RxQ; 6. Kt-B7 mate.</p>
          <p>We will now go a step further and turn from &ldquo;acute&rdquo; combinations
            to such combinations as are, as it were, impending. Here, too,
            I urgently recommend beginners (advanced players do it as a
            matter of course) to proceed by way of simple arithmetical
            calculations, but, instead of enumerating the attacking and
            defending pieces, to count the number of possibilities of attack
            and defence.</p>
          <p>Let us consider a few typical examples. In Diagram 9, if Black
            plays P-Q5, he must first have probed the position in the
            following way. The pawn at Q5 is attacked once and supported once
            to start with, and can be attacked by three more White units in
            three more moves (1. R-Q1, 2. R(B2)-Q2, 3. B-B2) Black can also
            mobilise three more units for the defence in the same number of
            moves (1. Kt-B4 or K3, 2. B-Kt2, 3. R-Q1). There is,
            consequently, no immediate danger, nor is there anything to fear
            for some time to come, as White has no other piece which could
            attack the pawn for the fifth time.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag09.jpg" width="400" height="394" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 9</p>
          </div>
          <p>It would be obviously wrong to move the pawn to Q6 after White&rsquo;s
            R-Q1, because White could bring another two pieces to bear on the
            P, the other Rook and the Knight, whilst Black has only one more
            piece available for the defence, namely, his Rook.
          </p>
          <p>The following examples show typical positions, in which simple
            calculation is complicated by side issues.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 10, the point of attack, namely, the Black Knight at
            KB3, can be supported by as many Black units as White can bring
            up for the attack, but the defensive efficiency of one of Black&rsquo;s
            pieces is illusory, because it can be taken by a White piece. The
            plan would be as follows: White threatens Black&rsquo;s Knight for the
            third time with Kt-K4, and Black must reply QKt-Q2, because
            covering with R-K3 would cost the &ldquo;exchange,&rdquo; as will appear from
            a comparison of the value of the pieces concerned. The &ldquo;exchange&rdquo;
            is, however, lost for Black on the next move, because</p>

          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            White&rsquo;s further attack on the Knight by Q-B3 forces the Rook to
            defend on K3, where it gets into the diagonal of the Bishop,
            which at present is masked by White&rsquo;s Knight. The sequel would be
            3. QKtxKtch, RxKt (not BxKt on account of BxR winning a whole
            Rook), 4. BxR, and so on. A similar case is shown in Diagram 11.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

            <p class="caption">Diag. 11</p>
          </div>
          <p>Here, too, there is a flaw in the simple calculation, because the
            defending units are not secure. Beginners should devote special
            attention to this position, which is in practice of frequent
            occurrence.</p>
          <p>It can be easily perceived that the Bishop cannot capture the
            pawn at B7 on account of P-QR3. But to take with the Knight would
            also be an error, because Black would then keep chasing away the
            covering Bishop.</p>
          <p>1. P-Kt4; 2. B-Q6, K-B3; 3. Kt-K8, B-B2; and wins one of the
            pieces.</p>
          <p>Finally, one more example, in which one of the defending pieces
            being pinned makes simple calculation impracticable.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 12 it seems at first sight as if Black could play
            KtxP: although White can pin the Knight with R-K1

          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            and then attack it once more with his Knight, Black would appear
            to have sufficient protection available, with his Kt and B. White
            has no time to double Rooks, because if he does so, after his R-
            K2 Black would play the King away from his file and allow the
            Knight to escape.</p>
          <p>But White can, by a simple sacrifice, bring the slumbering R at
            R1 into sudden action:
          </p>
          <p>1. … KtxP; 2 R-K1, B-B4; 3. Kt-B3, Kt-Q3; 4. RxKt, KtxR; 5. R-
            K1, and White wins two pieces for his Rook.</p>
          <p>These illustrations will be sufficient to give the beginner an
            understanding of economy of calculation in all kinds of
            combinations. His power of combining will grow speedily on this
            basis, and thrive in the fire of practical experience. Where an
            opponent is missing, the gap must be filled by reference to such
            books as treat of the science of combination and give examples
            taken from actual play.</p>

            GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CHESS STRATEGY</h2>
          <p>
            In bringing the teachings of this book under the collective
            heading &ldquo;Chess Strategy,&rdquo; it was not in any way my intention to
            draw anything like an exact parallel between the manœuvres on
            the chess-board and military operations in actual warfare. In
            trying to seek such analogies there is great danger of being led
            astray, and little likelihood of gaining knowledge that might be
            of use in practical play. Plain common-sense will give us all we
            need, without our being influenced by those tactical and
            strategical considerations that have been found useful in war.</p>
          <p>The following definition may not be out of place: Strategy sets
            down the whole of the problems which must be solved in war, in
            order to attain the ultimate result aimed at; tactics solve such
            problems in various ways, and according to the conditions
            prevailing in the particular case. Sound strategy, when setting
            the task, must never lose sight of tactical practicability, and
            only a thorough knowledge of tactical resources makes correct
            strategy possible.</p>
          <p>Now we shall not under any circumstances, as unfortunately even
            great chess masters have done, seek in outward similarities
            justification for transferring to chess the teachings of the
            strategy and tactics of war. It sounds pretty enough to say:
            Chess is a game of war—the various pieces represent the various
            kinds of forces: the pawns represent the infantry, the Knights
            take the place of cavalry, the Rooks do the work of heavy
            artillery, sweeping broad lines; the different ways in which the
            pieces move find a parallel in the topography of the theatre of
            war, in that the various battle-fields are more or less easy of
            access. But it is quite unjustifiable to assign to the Knights
            the functions of scouts, and to say that Rooks should stay in the
            background, as heavy artillery, and so on. Such pronouncements
            would not have the slightest practical value. What we take from
            the science of warfare is merely the definition. In each game the
            strategy of chess should set us the tasks which must be
            accomplished (in order to mate the opponent&rsquo;s King), and tactics
            point the way in which it is possible to solve such problems.
            Correct chess strategy will only set such tasks as are tactically
            possible, and, if we wish to expound the principles of chess
            strategy, we cannot exclude chess tactics from the field of our
            observations. If here and there the results of our deliberations
            bear some analogy to actual warfare, we may certainly give way to
            a kind of aesthetic satisfaction in that our own occupation has
            some parallel in real life, but we must never fashion our
            principles in accordance with such fortuitous circumstances.</p>
          <p>Having surveyed the problems we have to solve, we can now plunge
            into our subject.</p>
          <p>In the first chapter, when considering special cases in
            elementary combinations, we have already noticed the important
            part played in each skirmish by the balance between the attacking
            and defending units. Speaking quite generally, common-sense will
            tell us that, in all operations on the chess-board, the main
            consideration for the defence will be to maintain that balance,
            and that there is only justification for an attack when it is
            possible to concentrate more forces on the strategic point than
            can be mustered by the defence. However, one very important point
            must not be neglected, though I did not touch upon it when
            discussing elementary combinations for fear of complicating
            matters for beginners: the balance between the contending forces
            is by no means established by their numerical equality. A
            paramount factor is the mobility of such forces, and as soon as
            it is no longer one of the elementary cases of capture and
            recapture described previously, this factor must be taken into
            account in order to decide, on a general survey, whether there is
            a sufficient defence to an impending attack, or whether one&rsquo;s own
            intended attack is likely to prevail. That mobility is the first
            and foremost consideration should be self-evident, since the
            relative value of the pieces can only make itself felt by their
            greater or lesser mobility.</p>
          <p>Except in certain positions, which are brought about by some
            particular array of the pieces, the intrinsic value of a Rook is
            greater than that of a Bishop, because it can command all the
            squares on the board, whilst a Bishop is tied to its own colour;
            Knight and Bishop are considered equivalent, because the Knight&rsquo;s
            advantage in being able to act on all the squares of either
            colour is balanced by the fact that the Bishop can sweep long
            diagonals. Two Bishops are, generally speaking, of greater value
            than two Knights, because together they also act on all the
            squares, and their command of long diagonals is a clear
            advantage. The whole of this valuation, however, comes to nought
            when the pieces are hindered in their mobility by the peculiarity
            of any particular position.</p>
          <p>We will consider one instance from end-game play, and one from
            the openings.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 13, White derives no advantage from being</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p class="noindent">
            the exchange to the good, for the Rook has no file which could be
            used to break into the Black camp.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 14, the numerical equality of forces will not save
            Black, because bad development reduces the mobility of his pieces
            to such an extent that he has no resources with which he can
            parry the impending attack.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag14.jpg" width="400" height="395" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 14</p>
          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            White will assail the Black King&rsquo;s position on the Queen side,
            and Black is unable to concentrate his forces quickly enough for
            the defence of the jeopardised entrenchments. Let us therefore
            bear in mind that the mobility of the pieces is the deciding
            factor of their efficiency, and that mobility is the highest
            criterion by which to judge the merits (or demerits) of their
            operations.</p>
          <p>We will now consider this principle in its application to the
            three stages of play, namely, the opening, the middle-game, and
            the ending.</p>

          <h2><a name="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
            THE OPENING</h2>
          <p>The only pieces available on the first move are the Knights. In
            order to develop other pieces as well, it is necessary to move
            pawns first, and such pawn moves will be best as give an outlet
            to as many pieces as possible. For quick development is of the
            utmost importance, and he who succeeds first in placing all his
            pieces, from their initial awkward positions, to such places as
            give them command of the greatest possible number of squares, has
            the better chance of concentrating a superior force on some
            important point.</p>
          <p>It follows that White, having the first move, is, so to speak,
            always morally justified in attacking, whilst Black should assume
            the defensive. It is a step in the right direction, to appreciate
            the truth of this proposition. Unfortunately most beginners fail
            to realise it, and so pave the way, from the first, to the loss
            of the game.</p>
          <p>There are not many developing pawn moves to choose from.
            Apparently from the point of view of quick development only P-K4
            and P-Q4 need be considered, since they free both Bishop and
            Queen, whilst other pawn moves liberate one piece only. Generally
            speaking it is only required to move two or three pawns to allow
            all pieces to be developed, and it is good, on principle, to make
            only such pawn moves in the opening, which are necessary for the
            development of pieces. To play other pawns really means the loss
            of a move. To &ldquo;lose a move&rdquo; means to make a move which is not
            essential to the attainment of a desired position. Thus the &ldquo;loss
            of a move&rdquo; results also from playing a piece to a given square in
            more moves than necessary.</p>
          <p>I shall now give a few games showing the far-reaching
            consequences of losing moves. The first one is a typical though
            glaring example, which is very instructive and came to my notice
            some time ago:</p>

          <p>I will not discuss the system of development adopted by White in
            his first four moves. The last move, however, can at once be
            recognised as faulty. It is the loss of a move such as occurs in
            the vast majority of games played by beginners. It was
            unnecessary to prevent KKt-Kt5, since the Knight could not hold
            that square permanently. In any case B-K2 would have had the same
            effect, and developed a piece at the same time.</p>

          <p>Another Queen&rsquo;s move. The attack on the Bishop&rsquo;s Pawn may be very
            tempting, but must necessarily be incorrect—and why? Because
            White is much behind with his development. It is useless to
            analyse any kind of attack in face of this fact. The beginner
            finds it hard to get used to this way of thinking. He prefers to
            try to unravel a long string of variations and combinations, in
            which he will mostly lose his bearings. Even stronger players
            obstruct their own powers by refusing to see the value of judging
            a position on general merits. They lose valuable time in thinking
            out endless variations, to maintain positions which could be
            proved valueless by general and logical deductions.</p>

          <p>A further example in which the loss of moves occurs, though not
            so glaringly, is the following famous game, which Morphy played
            against the Duke Karl of Brunswick and Count Isouard in the Royal
            box at the Paris opera-house.</p>
          <table summary="" style="margin-left: 3em; ">

            <tr>
              <td>2. Kt-KB3</td>
              <td>P-Q3</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>According to the principles set out above, Kt-QB3 would have been
            better, since the text move shuts out the King&rsquo;s Bishop.</p>
          <table summary="" style="margin-left: 3em; ">
            <tr>
              <td>3. P-Q4</td>
              <td></td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>Now the King&rsquo;s Pawn is attacked twice. It would be bad to support
            it with Kt-QB3, as White would exchange pawns and then Queens.
            Black would thus forfeit his chance of castling and lose much
            time in bringing the King into safety and the Rooks into play. P-
            KB3, of course, is impossible, as it is not a developing move,
            and moreover blocks the natural development of the King&rsquo;s Knight.
            Protecting the pawn with the Queen would also block other pieces,
            and QKt-Q2 cannot be good, as it blocks the Queen&rsquo;s Bishop.</p>
          <p>Since it seems impossible to protect the King&rsquo;s Pawn, the only
            alternative would be to exchange it; indeed it is on the whole
            the best course, although it allows a White piece to take up a
            dominating position in the centre. Wishing to avoid this, Black
            plays</p>

            and, by pinning the opponent&rsquo;s Knight, indirectly protects the
            King&rsquo;s Pawn. This manœuvre is, however, ill-advised, as Black is
            forced to exchange the Bishop for the Knight. The Bishop will
            have moved twice, the Knight only once, therefore White will have
            gained a move for his development.</p>

          <p>White has now two pieces more in play than Black, instead of only
            one, and the mobility of the White Queen, which Black himself has
            brought out, begins to have a threatening effect on Black&rsquo;s game.</p>

          <p>Black cannot cover his King&rsquo;s Bishop&rsquo;s Pawn with Q-Q2 because 8.
            QxP wins the Rook, whilst now Black could play 8. … Q-Kt5ch in
            reply, forcing the exchange of Queens. The text move, which is
            forced, blocks the Bishop, and at the same time prevents the
            development of the King&rsquo;s Rook, all of which is the direct
            consequence of the loss of one move.</p>

          <p>White rightly disdains the gain of the Knight&rsquo;s Pawn, but
            prevents the exchange of Queens in developing a piece. He proves
            the superiority of his position much more convincingly in that
            way. Black must now lose yet another move to protect his Knight&rsquo;s
            Pawn.</p>

          <p>Black must try to develop his Queen&rsquo;s Knight at last. He cannot
            play QKt-Q2 at once, since his Knight&rsquo;s Pawn would again be
            unprotected; therefore he plays the move in the text, probably
            thinking that now White also must lose a move to withdraw his
            Bishop. But in view of the fact that Black&rsquo;s game is wholly
            undeveloped, and that he plays practically several pieces down,
            White sacrifices his Knight for two pawns: he foresees the
            position which occurs a few moves later, when Black is hemmed in
            on all sides.</p>

          <p>This is the only piece available to cover Q2, for the King&rsquo;s
            Knight is pinned. White has another piece in reserve, his King&rsquo;s

            can follow the loss of a move, since it often leads to the
            compulsory loss of further moves in the course of the game.</p>

            &ldquo;This is the curse of every evil deed<br />
            That propagating still it brings forth evil.&rdquo;
          </p>
          <p>The logical sequence of the moves in this game, as pointed out in
            the commentaries to it, is borne out by the curious coincidence
            that I once had the opportunity of playing a game in exactly the
            same sequence of moves, against a player to whom Morphy&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;brilliancy&rdquo; was unknown.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>The leading principle of all opening moves is made clear by the
            foregoing pages, namely, rapid development of pieces, and
            consequently the avoidance of the loss of a move in any shape or
            form.</p>
          <p>Before treating of the various systems of openings, I will say a
            few words on the principles of PAWN PLAY.</p>
          <p>Each opening is characterised by a well-defined pawn formation,
            and concurrently a certain method in the development of the
            pieces. Naturally the formation of a pawn skeleton is not an
            independent factor, but must be evolved with a view to
            facilitating the favourable development of pieces. But when
            considering the form of a pawn position and that of the pieces,
            we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that pawn formation must
            necessarily be the dominant consideration in our mind. Pawn
            formation is of a more permanent character than that of the
            pieces, in consequence of the latter&rsquo;s greater mobility. When we
            have made a rash move with a piece, to which our attacking
            disposition may have tempted us, we may still have a chance of
            retrieving the position by timely retreat. Once a pawn has moved
            it cannot turn back, and only after the greatest deliberation
            should we embark on changes in our pawn formation in order not to
            disturb the balance of this &ldquo;static element&rdquo; of the game. But we
            shall see that the pawn skeleton which was formed in the opening
            often weathers the storm and stress of the middle game, and
            frequently preserves its character right up to the end-game. I
            will therefore make pawn formation my starting-point in an
            attempt to show the way through the maze of the openings on the
            basis of general strategical principles.</p>
          <p>If our pawn skeleton is to promote the freedom of all the pieces,
            we must not build it up with the narrow view of developing minor
            pieces only, but must consider from the very first in which way
            it will enable the Rooks to get into action. We can unite these
            tendencies in making the CENTRE OF THE BOARD the main field of
            action for all our forces. This means for both sides K4 and Q4,
            and also in a lesser degree QB4 and KB4. We shall get a clear
            insight into the positional advantage of having command of the
            centre later on, when discussing the middle game. At present I
            will only touch the subject in a general way, explaining it in an
            elementary form, which will be sufficient to develop an
            understanding for pawn strategy in the opening. In the course of
            further deductions, after the grasp of this difficult stage of
            the game has become stronger, I will go into details which will
            allow the subject to be stated in a more precise form.</p>
          <p>Placing the pieces in the centre is of value, because there they
            have more mobility than near the edge, which, of course, limits
            their range of action, and also because from the centre a
            concentration of forces on a given point can generally be
            effected in the quickest way.</p>
          <p>In most cases two centre squares become inaccessible at once,
            through the opponent placing one of his pawns in the centre;
            therefore it would seem a good plan to lure that pawn away, and
            this is rendered feasible by playing P-K4 or P-QB4 when the
            opponent has a pawn on his Q4, and P-Q4 or P-KB4 when he has a
            pawn on K4. In the following we will consider such manœuvres as
            could apply either to White or Black, from the point of view of
            White, to whom the initiative is, as pointed out above, a sort of
            birth-right. Naturally, should White lose a move, as, for
            instance, 1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. Kt-KB3, Kt-QB3; 3. P-QR3? the
            position is reversed, and Black is bound to obtain the initiative
            which is White&rsquo;s birthright.</p>
          <p>The pawn moves mentioned above also have the tendency of giving
            the Rooks an opportunity for action. A Rook standing behind an
            advanced pawn may support its further advance, or, if the pawn
            should be exchanged, might get an open file.</p>
          <p>The damage we wish to inflict on our opponent we must, of course,
            try to avoid ourselves. Thus we will not easily give up a centre
            pawn unless we can obtain some other advantage in doing so. This
            advantage may be, that in exchanging the centre pawn we open up
            lines of attack for our pieces, or that we are able to place one
            of our pieces in a commanding position in the centre of the
            board.</p>
          <p>The following example may serve as an illustration. Supposing
            White plays after

          <h5> 1. P-Q4 P-Q4
            2. P-QB4</h5>
          <p>His aim is to tempt Black&rsquo;s centre pawn away and to make his QB4
            and K4 accessible for his own forces. Black might be justified in
            taking the pawn, if he really could hold the pawn thus gained. We
            shall show later on that this is not so, and that White can win
            it back easily and advantageously. Therefore Black is more
            likely to play 2. P-K3. Not 2. … Kt-KB3; for after 3. PxP,
            KtxP; 4. P-K4 would open White&rsquo;s game and drive the Knight away
            at once, gaining a move. Supposing, however, Black plays 2. …
            B-B4; should White now think mechanically, &ldquo;I will take his
            centre pawn and consequently have the better game,&rdquo; his deduction
            would be wrong. For after exchanging his Bishop for the Knight,
            which otherwise would drive his Queen away, Black brings the
            latter into a dominating square in the centre.</p>

          <p>Black&rsquo;s Queen cannot easily be driven away from her commanding
            position, particularly as White must lose a move to save his QRP.
            Meanwhile Black gains time for concentrating his forces for an
            attack which wins the Queen&rsquo;s Pawn.</p>

          <p>and P-K4 is again a threat hard for white to meet.</p>
          <p>This position shows, that to bring one&rsquo;s opponent&rsquo;s centre pawn
            away and to keep one&rsquo;s own, does not under all circumstances mean
            the command of the centre, but that the opening up of files and
            diagonals for one&rsquo;s pieces towards the centre is an important
            moment in the fight for positional advantage.</p>
          <p>Considerations of this kind will help to improve our judgment in
            many of the various openings treated in the following pages.</p>
          <p>We will class the openings in this way:</p>
          <p> A. White 1. P-K4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 16%; margin-right: 16%"> (a) Black 1. P-K4

            (b) Black 1. Any other move</p>
          <p> C. White 1. Any other move</p>
          <p>We shall find that openings classed under C generally lead to
            positions treated under A and B.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>A. We have already come to the conclusion that after 1. P-K4, P-
            K4 White does well to try to force the exchange of Black&rsquo;s centre
            pawn on Q4 or KB4, and that Black will try to counteract this,
            unless by allowing the exchange he gets a chance of exerting
            pressure in the centre by means of his pieces.</p>
          <p>We will first see what happens when White undertakes the advance
            in question on his second move. Superficially the difference
            between 2. PQ4 and 2. P-KB4 is that in the first case the pawn
            thus advanced is covered, while in the second it is not. An
            opening in which a pawn sacrifice is offered, is called a
            &ldquo;gambit&rdquo;; 2. P-KB4 is therefore a gambit.</p>
          <p>2. P-Q4 is only a gambit if after 2. … PxP White does not
            recapture the pawn. Nevertheless this opening has been called the
            &ldquo;centre gambit,&rdquo; and though the denomination is not correct we
            will adhere to it, as it is in general use.</p>
          <p>A very considerable difference between the centre gambit and the
            King&rsquo;s gambit lies in the fact that in the former acceptance is
            compulsory, whilst in the second it may be declined.</p>
          <p>For: 2. P-Q4 threatens to take the King&rsquo;s Pawn. To defend it by
            means of 2. … P-Q3 is unwise, since White exchanges pawns and
            then Queens, by which Black loses his chance of castling and
            impedes the development of his Rooks. 2. … Kt-QB3 is also bad,
            since after 3. PxP, KtxP; 4 P-KB4, White drives the Knight away,
            gaining a strong hold on the centre, and Black has no
            compensation for giving up his centre pawn. It may be mentioned
            here that after 2. … Kt-QB3, 3. P-Q5 would be a useless move,
            as to begin with it would be inconsequent, since P-Q4 was played
            in order to clear the centre, and moreover it would block up a
            diagonal which could be most useful to the King&rsquo;s Bishop.</p>
          <p>We conclude now that Black cannot hold his pawn at K4. He must
            relinquish the centre by 2. … PxP. He will now either attempt
            to bring away White&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s Pawn by advancing his own QP to Q4,
            or try to utilise the King&rsquo;s file, which was opened by his second
            move, and operate against White&rsquo;s KP. The Rooks are indicated for
            this task. We shall refer to the execution of these plans later
            on.</p>
          <p>In the King&rsquo;s gambit, White&rsquo;s attempt to bring away Black&rsquo;s
            King&rsquo;s Pawn may be safely ignored.
          </p>
          <p>The move 2. P-KB4 does not threaten to take the King&rsquo;s Pawn, as
            Black would win White&rsquo;s KP by Q-R5ch. Black can therefore develop
            in security with 2. … B-B4, and if then White prevents the Q
            check by Kt-KB3, there is no objection to Black protecting his
            King&rsquo;s Pawn with P-Q3, as the King&rsquo;s Bishop is already developed.
            After 4. B-B4, Black has still no need to protect his KP with Kt-
            QB3, but can play Kt-KB3 first, because after 5. PxP, PxP; 6.
            KtxP would be answered by 6. … Q-Q5 winning a piece. Black
            keeps the upper hand in these early encounters because he has
            made a developing move with a piece, whilst White has played a
            pawn move which is useless for the purpose of development.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag18.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 18</p>
          </div>
          <p>Diagram 18 shows the position which results from the following
            plausible moves:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 2. P-KB4 B-B4
            3. Kt-KB3 P-Q3
            4. B-B4 Kt-KB3
            5. P-Q3 Kt-B3
            6. Kt-B3 B-KKt5</p>
          <p>If White wishes to castle on the K side, which must have been his
            intention when playing 2. P-KB4, he will have to play Kt-QR4 and
            KtxB.</p>
          <p>Though this is of no disadvantage to Black, he could avoid the
            exchange of his KB by playing 2. … P-QR3 instead of B-KKt5. If
            then White plays P-B5 in order to hinder the development of
            Black&rsquo;s QB and to bring out his own, the pressure on Black&rsquo;s KP
            is relieved permanently, and sooner or later Black will break
            through on the Q file, as his QP is no longer needed at Q3 for
            the support of the centre pawn.</p>
          <p>A different pawn formation is the result if White enforces the
            exchange of Black&rsquo;s centre pawn at once. This he can do by
            playing P-Q4, e.g.:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 6%; margin-right: 6%"> 2. P-KB4 B-B4 or 4. P-B3 Kt-KB3
            3. Kt-KB3 P-Q3 5. P-Q4 PxQP
            4. P-Q4 PxQP 6. PxP B-Kt3
            5. KtxP</p>
          <p>Here Black can get an early advantage by attacking White&rsquo;s KP,
            taking possession of the K file after castling on the K side.</p>
          <p>All things considered, the student should in my opinion decline
            the gambit, as in doing so he can get an easy and satisfactory
            development. The treatment of the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Gambit accepted,&rdquo; which
            aims at holding the gambit pawn, is most difficult and leads
            early in the game to such complications as none but an expert can
            hope to master.</p>
          <p>[Footnote: As an example of the difficult play which ensues when
            Black defends the pawn in the King&rsquo;s Gambit, I give the latest
            variation of an attack introduced by Professor I. L. Rice, and
            called the &ldquo;Rice Gambit&rdquo;:</p>
          <p>1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. P-KB4, PxP; 3. Kt-KB3, P-KKt4; 4. P-KR4, P-Kt5;
            5. Kt-K5, Kt-KB3; 6. B-B4, P-Q4; 7. PxP, B-Q3; 8. Castles! BxKt;
            9. R-K1, Q-K2; 10. P-B3, Kt-R4; 11. P-Q4, Kt-Q2; 12. PxB, KtxP;
            13. P-QKt3, Castles; 14. B-R3, Kt-B6ch!; 15. PxKt, QxP; 16. R-K5!
            B-B4!!; 17. Kt-Q2! Q-Kt6ch; 18. K-B1, Q-R7; 19. BxR, P-Kt6; 20.
            B-B5, P-Kt7ch; 21. K-K1, Q-R5ch; 22. K-K2, Kt-Kt6ch; 23. K-B2,
            Kt-K5ch; 24. KxP, B-R6ch; 25. K-R1, K-R1; 26. KtxKt, R-KKt1; 27.
            R-Kt5, with interesting possibilities.</p>
          <p>Numberless interesting variations are possible, but their
            discussion does not lie within the scope of this work. They will
            be found in books treating of the analysis of the openings.]</p>
          <p>It is therefore unwise for the beginner to accept the gambit,
            unless there be a chance of compensation for the disappearance of
            his centre pawn, by forcing the exchange of White&rsquo;s centre pawn
            as well. The following line of play would fulfil this condition:</p>
          <p>1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. P-KB4, PxP; 3. Kt-KB3, Kt-KB3; 4. Kt-B3, P-Q4!
            Black thereby abandons the gambit pawn.</p>
          <p>On principle, and when he has the choice, the beginner should
            give preference to simple and clear development in the opening,
            rather than to the gain of a pawn, when this involves difficult
            and intricate play. This principle must also guide us in other
            openings.</p>
          <p>A good example is to be found in the so-called &ldquo;Danish gambit,&rdquo;
            [Footnote: The names of the various openings, which I mention for
            the sake of completeness, are generally derived from towns or
            countries in which they were first extensively played and
            analysed.] which will lead us back to those openings in which
            White plays P-Q4 on his second move. After 2. P-Q4, PxP, White
            has the option of sacrificing two pawns to obtain a very rapid
            development 3. P-QB3, PxP; 4. B-QB4, PxP; 5. QBxP. It may now be
            just possible for Black to avoid the many threats which White can
            bring to bear with his beautifully placed forces, perhaps by
            giving back one or both of the pawns gained. But this question
            can only be of interest to us if there is no opportunity of
            adopting a simple line of development at the outset. As it is,
            this opportunity is not wanting. All that Black needs to do is to
            push on his Queen&rsquo;s Pawn as soon as possible, thus freeing his
            own Queen&rsquo;s Bishop.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 2. P-Q4 PxP
            3. P-QB3 P-Q4</p>

            <p class="caption">Diag. 19</p>
          </div>
          <p>After 4. KPxP, QxP, Black&rsquo;s position is at least as easy of
            development as White&rsquo;s. In the position set out in Diagram 19,
            White cannot play P-K5, because Black wins a pawn by PxP without
            hindering his own development in the least. The equalising power
            of Black&rsquo;s P-Q4 in all KP openings where White has played P-Q4
            can be noticed in many variations. I shall now give a few typical
            examples, which will show the line of play that can be adopted in
            many similar cases, and which can often be evolved one from the
            other by altering the order of the moves.</p>

            6. KtxKt KtPxKt
            7. B-Q3 P-Q4!</p>
          <p>In no case should Black forfeit his chance of playing P-Q4. It is
            tempting after 2. P-Q4, PxP; 3. Kt-KB3 to cover the pawn at Q5 by
            P-QB4, but in that case White would sacrifice a pawn by P-QB3, by
            this means opening the Queen&rsquo;s file for himself, and so
            preventing Black from ever playing P-Q4. Thus, for the loss of a
            pawn, White has a paramount advantage in position.</p>
          <p>For after 4. … PxP, 5. KtxP (Diagram 20) White has developed
            both Knights, and his Bishops are free, whilst Black has none of
            his pieces out. P-Q3 must also be played in order to mobilise the
            Queen&rsquo;s Bishop, leaving K2 as the only square for the King&rsquo;s
            Bishop; finally the &ldquo;backward&rdquo; pawn [Footnote: A pawn is said to
            be &ldquo;backward,&rdquo; when it cannot move into cover by another pawn.]
            at Q3 is open to constant attacks and is difficult to defend.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag20.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 20</p>
          </div>
          <p>The best plan for Black is to decline the doubtful gift of the
            pawn and to bring about one of the positions, as sketched above,
            in which, by playing P-Q4 early in the game, Black is sure of the
            free development of all his forces.</p>
          <p>Black is able to play P-Q4 early in all such openings, where
            White does not force the defensive move P-Q3 by attacking Black&rsquo;s
            King&rsquo;s Pawn. For instance, in the King&rsquo;s gambit, since the move
            2. P-KB4 does not threaten PxP, Black can reply at once by 2. …
            P-Q4 (Falkbeer Counter Gambit). After 3. PxQP, P-K5 (to permit of
            Kt-KB3, which at present is not feasible on account of 4. PxP);
            4. P-Q3, PxP; 5. QxP, White is a pawn ahead, but his Queen
            obstructs his KB; therefore Black has better developing chances
            and should be able to win the pawn back at the very least.</p>
          <p>A second example is the Vienna game, which proceeds as follows:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 2. Kt-QB3 Kt-KB3
            3. P-B4 P-Q4 (Diagram 21)</p>
          <p>If White plays 4. PxQP, Black can play P-K5, as in the Falkbeer
            gambit mentioned just now. In answer to 4. PxKP, on the other
            hand, Black can play KtxP without having the slightest difficulty
            with his development. For instance,</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%"> 5. Kt-KB3 B-K2
            6. P-Q4 P-KB3
            7. B-Q3 KtxKt
            8. PxKt Castles
            9. Castles Kt-B3 or B-KKt5</p>
          <p>and Black also will soon have an open file for his Rook, with no
            disadvantage in position.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag21.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 21</p>
          </div>
          <p>There is, however, one opening in which Black has the utmost
            difficulty in preventing White from getting a positional
            advantage in the centre. It is called the Ruy Lopez, and is held
            by many to be the strongest opening for White. The initial moves
            are: 1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. Kt-KB3, Kt-QB3; 3. B-Kt5. With this move
            White at once attacks the Black KP, though indirectly, by
            threatening to exchange the B for the Kt. To make the capture
            effective, however, White must first protect his own King&rsquo;s Pawn,
            which would otherwise be lost after 4. BxKt, QPxB; 5. KtxP, Q-
            Q5!. At first, therefore, Black need not provide against the
            threatened exchange.</p>
          <p>I shall treat at some length the various defences from which
            Black can choose, and in studying this most important King&rsquo;s side
            opening, we shall have occasion to note many points of general
            interest for operations in the centre.</p>
          <p>Broadly speaking, two entirely different systems of defence can
            be distinguished: either Black will try to maintain his centre
            pawn, or else, giving up the centre, try to gain some other
            advantage as compensation.</p>
          <p>Black can only maintain his centre pawn if he can prevent his QKt
            from being exchanged. As is readily seen, White can attack
            Black&rsquo;s KP a second time with P-Q4, whilst after Black&rsquo;s P-Q3 any
            other defensive move would hinder development. These
            considerations lead to the first main line of defence in which
            Black plays 3. … P-QR3. After 4. B-R4 Black has the option of
            releasing the pin by playing P-QKt4 at some opportune moment. If
            White elects to exchange his Bishop for the Kt forthwith, he can
            remove the Black centre pawn after 4. … QPxB by playing 5. P-
            Q4, but the exchange of the B for the Kt gives Black a free
            development and in consequence a good game. (Compare note to move
            4 in Game No. 12.)</p>
          <p>Diagram 22 reproduces a typical position in this defence. The
            more usual continuation for White is 4. B-R4, Kt-B3;</p>

            5. Castles; he does not trouble to protect his KP as its capture
            would allow his Rook an open file on which to act against the
            opposing King (compare Games Nos. 14 and 17) 5. … B-K2. Now
            Black can capture the KP without much risk, as the Bishop is on
            the King&rsquo;s file. 6. R-K1, White covers his pawn, and thereby
            threatens to win a pawn by BxKt. Therefore Black must not delay
            playing 6. … P-QKt4.</p>
          <p>After 7. B-Kt3, P-Q3; (Diagram 22) White cannot yet execute the
            manœuvre which underlies the whole tendency of the Ruy Lopez,
            namely P-Q4, maintaining the pressure in the centre, because
            after KtxQP, 9. KtxKt, PxKt; 10. QxP? White loses a piece
            through 10. … P-B4, etc. It is therefore necessary to play P-
            QB3 first. White could also obtain a rapid development by Kt-B3,
            P-Q3, B-K3 or Kt5, but this arrangement is not popular, because
            Black can play Kt-QR4 and exchange the valuable KB. The pawn at
            QB3 supports an advance in the centre, and also provides a
            retreat for the KB. The QKt can be developed in this way: Kt-Q2-
            B1-Kt3 or K3. Black, however, must try to round off his pawn
            position on the Queen&rsquo;s side, by moving his QBP into line.
            Black&rsquo;s pawns at K4 and QB4 then exert a pressure on White&rsquo;s Q4.
            And this pressure threatens to be reinforced by B-Kt5. From these
            considerations the following development seems to be natural: 8.
            P-B3, Kt-QR4; 9. B-B2, P-B4; 10. P-Q4, Q-B2 (to support the KP);
            it leads to the position in Diagram 23.</p>

          <h5> 11. P-KR3</h5>
          <p>One of the few instances in which this pawn move is justified.
            It deprives Black&rsquo;s QB of its only good square, and saves the
            K Kt, the co-operation of which is urgently needed in the centre.
          </p>
          <p>This system of opening will receive more exhaustive treatment
            under the heading of &ldquo;Middle Game.&rdquo; (Compare Game No. 12.)</p>
          <p>In the second main line of defence, of which I shall treat now,
            Black renounces the maintenance of his KP, and makes an attempt
            to find compensation by attacking White&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s Pawn. The King&rsquo;s
            file, opened by the disappearance of the Black pawn, offers
            opportunities for that purpose. After the first few moves we
            arrive at the following position, which</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag24.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="[Illustration]" />

          <p class="noindent">
            may be reached thus: 3. B-Kt5, P-Q3; 4. P-Q4, B-Q2; 5. Kt-B3, Kt-
            B3; 6. Castles, B-K2; 7. R-K1, PxP; 8. KtxP, Castles. The
            exchange on the seventh move is compulsory, because the loss of a
            pawn after BxKt is in effect threatened, now that the White KP is
            supported by the Rook.</p>
          <p>Black&rsquo;s intention of exerting pressure on the KP is now difficult
            of execution, because his pieces are very cramped and hinder one
            another in a restricted area. The KB in particular cannot be
            brought into action without great difficulty, for instance by: R-
            K1, B-KB1, P-KKt3, and B-Kt2. It is therefore advisable for
            White to develop his QB at Kt2 instead of at Kt5, in order not to
            give Black a chance of exchanging his troublesome Bishop. (In a
            game Bernstein-Emanuel Lasker, Moscow, 1914, there happened 9.
            BxKt, PxB; 10. B-Kt5, P-KR3; 11. B-R4, Kt-R2; 12. BxB, QxB with a
            good game for Black.)</p>
          <p>The defence has a totally different trend, if Black gives up his
            own KP, but captures the White KP at once. I have already pointed
            out that White would not mind his KP being taken, in view of the
            attack on the open King&rsquo;s file. Let us now consider in which way
            this attack can be planned. There are two essentially different
            lines, according to whether Black interpolates P-QR3 or not.</p>
          <p>After 3. B-Kt5, Kt-B3; 4. Castles, KtxP; 5. R-K1, Black gets out
            of it comfortably by playing Kt-Q3, B-K2 and Castles, and White
            cannot permanently prevent Black&rsquo;s game from being freed by the
            advance of the QP. P-Q4 for White on the fifth move is therefore
            stronger. Black cannot very well exchange the pawns, leaving the
            King&rsquo;s file quite exposed, and must submit to White playing PxP,
            maintaining the pawn at K5 and preventing Black&rsquo;s P-Q4 for some
            time to come.</p>
          <p>The opening might continue in this way: 5. P-Q4, B-K2; 6. Q-K2,
            Kt-Q3; 7. BxKt, KtPxB (to make room for the Kt); 8. PxP, Kt-Kt2
            (Diagram 25).
          </p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag25.jpg" width="400" height="395" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 25</p>
          </div>
          <p>The whole of the manœuvres now centre round Black&rsquo;s endeavours
            to force his P-Q4, and White&rsquo;s attempt to prevent it. Black
            ultimately gains his point, as will be seen, but at the expense
            of such disadvantages in the pawn position that it is
            questionable whether the whole variation (called the Rio de
            Janeiro Defence) is playable.</p>
          <p>9. Kt-B3, Castles; 10. R-K1, Kt-B4 (the Knight is to be posted at
            K3 to bring the White KKt away from his Q4, whence he prevents
            the advance of Black&rsquo;s QP by attacking QB6); 11. Kt-Q4, Kt-K3;
            12. B-K3, KtxKt; 13. BxKt, P-B4; 14. B-K3, P-Q4; 15. PxP e.p.,
            BxP. This is the critical position in the Rio de Janeiro
            defence. Black has succeeded in eliminating the White centre
            pawn, and sweeps long diagonals with his Bishops, but the
            advantage cannot be maintained. White exchanges the Bishop at Q6,
            and there remains a backward pawn, which Black will hardly be
            able to hold permanently. In practice it has been shown that the
            end-game should be won by White in spite of Bishops of opposite
            colours, as Black&rsquo;s pawn at his QB4 is difficult to defend.</p>
          <p>16. Kt-K4, B-Kt2; 17. KtxB (not BxP because of BxB; 18. KtxB, BxP
            followed by Q-Kt4ch), PxKt; 18. Q R-Q1 and P-QB4.</p>
          <p>The game is much more favourable for Black if he first plays 3.
            … P-QR3, and retains the option of driving the White KB away by
            P-QKt4, after which P-Q4 can be enforced very soon. 3. B-Kt5, P-
            QR3; 4. B-R4, Kt-B3; 5. Castles, KtxP; 6. P-Q4, P-QKt4; 7. B-Kt3,
            P-Q4; 8. PxP, B-K3, 9. P-B3.
          </p>
          <p>Now Black&rsquo;s pieces are more mobile, and that is the reason why
            this system of defence is becoming more popular than any other.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, it cannot be denied that Black&rsquo;s pawn
            formation on the Q side is weak, and that his centre is less
            secure. Whilst White has a pawn firmly posted in the centre,
            Black has a Knight there which will soon be driven away. White&rsquo;s
            Q4, the basis of his centre, is entirely in his hands, whilst
            Black&rsquo;s Q4 is exposed to a steady pressure by the White pieces.
            Finally Black&rsquo;s QKt is unfavourably placed, obstructing as it
            does the QBP and preventing its falling into line with its
            fellows.</p>
          <p>Diagram 26 shows the position after 9. P-B3. The latter move
            prevents the exchange of the B after Black&rsquo;s Kt-R4, an exchange
            which would allow Black to round up his pawn formation with P-
            QB4. The experts are not yet agreed as to the best continuation
            for Black in this critical position. To be considered are the
            moves B-QB4, B-K2 and Kt-B4. B-K2 is preferred nowadays to B-
            QB4, as QB4 should be kept free for the KKt in case the latter is
            driven from his dominating position, e.g. 10. R-K1 and 11. Q Kt-
            Q2. For if in that case Black exchanges the Knights, he only
            furthers White&rsquo;s development without doing anything towards
            strengthening his Q4.</p>
          <p>If Black covers the Knight with P-B4, White plays PxP e.p. and
            Kt-Kt5, rids himself of Black&rsquo;s QB, and thereby weakens Black&rsquo;s
            QP still more.
          </p>
          <p>Kt-B4 would therefore seem to be the best choice, as the QB
            becomes mobile again after White&rsquo;s B-B2, nor can White</p>

          <p class="noindent">
            play P-Q4 as yet. The position in the diagram therefore leads to
            the following variations:</p>
          <p>A. 9. … B-K2; 10. R-K1, Castles; 11. QKt-Q2, Kt-B4; 12. B-B2,
            B-KKt5. This manœuvre was introduced by Em. Lasker (Petrograd,
            1909. For further particulars see Game No. 15).</p>
          <p>B. 9. … Kt-B4; 10. QKt-Q2, P-Q5 (Capablanca-Em. Lasker,
            Petrograd, 1914); or 9. … B-K2; 10. R-K1, Castles; 11. QKt-Q2,
            Kt-B4; 12. B-B2, P-Q5 (Em. Lasker-Tarrasch, Petrograd, 1914).
          </p>
          <p>Capablanca believes that the early advance of P-Q5 can be refuted
            by Kt-K4, e.g. 9. … B-K2; 10. QKt-Q2, Kt-B4; 11. B-B2, P-Q5;
            12. Kt-K4, PxP; 13. KtxKt, BxKt; 14. B-K4, Q-Q2; 15. Q-B2 or PxP.</p>
          <p>The openings as sketched out up to this point give a sufficiently
            clear idea of the possibilities of combining sound development
            with an attempt to capture the centre after the opening moves 1.
            P-K4, P-K4. In most cases, Black&rsquo;s centre pawn being open to
            attack by White&rsquo;s P-Q4, we find an early break-up of the centre,
            and concurrently the opening of the Ks or Qs file for the Rooks.
            That is why games opened in this fashion have been classed very
            generally as &ldquo;open,&rdquo; whilst all the other openings are called
            &ldquo;close games.&rdquo; Lately the distinction has been abandoned, and
            very rightly, since in the latter openings, too, the centre can
            be cleared occasionally. We attain typical close positions when
            Black does not play 1. … P-K4 in answer to 1. P-K4, but
            relinquishes all claim on his K4 and takes possession of his Q4
            instead, leaving White the option of interlocking the pawns in
            the centre with P-K5.</p>
          <p>On principle it does not seem advisable for Black to play P-Q4 on
            the first move in reply to 1. P-K4. Although White&rsquo;s centre pawn
            disappears after 2. PxP, QxP, Black loses a move through 3. Kt-
            QB3, and his Queen has no place from which it cannot be driven
            away very soon, unless it be at Q1. This, however, would amount
            to an admission of the inferiority of the whole of Black&rsquo;s plan.</p>
          <p>There are two moves which deserve consideration as a preliminary
            to P-Q4, namely, 1. … P-K3 (French Defence)</p>

            and P-QB3 (Caro-Kann defence). After 2. P-Q4, P-Q4, we attain the
            positions set out in the Diagrams 27 and 28, to which we must
            devote a good deal of attention.</p>
          <p>These openings are worthy of study as being especially
            interesting examples of the struggle for the centre.</p>
          <p>As early as the third move, White has to take an important
            decision. Is he to play P-K5 and prevent the opening of</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

            the K or Q file for a long time to come, or should he proceed to
            develop his pieces, and leave Black the option of anticipating
            the blocking of the centre by playing PxP himself?</p>
          <p>I shall first turn my attention to those games in which White
            plays P-K5, starting with the French Defence, after which the
            Caro-Kann Defence will be easily understood.</p>
          <p>The position which ensues in the centre after 1. P-K4, P-K3; 2.
            P-Q4, P-Q4; 3. P-K5, divides the board diagonally, and it is easy
            to recognise roughly the main lines of play which will govern the
            game. White has more scope on the King&rsquo;s side, where his pieces
            will have greater mobility, and prospects of attack. Black&rsquo;s
            chances are on the Queen&rsquo;s side. Both sides will have to advance
            more pawns in order to obtain openings for their Rooks, and use
            them for the attack, since they have no future on the K and Q
            files, as was the case in the openings mentioned hitherto.</p>
          <p>The obvious moves to this end are: for White the advance of the
            KBP, for Black that of the QBP and sometimes even of the QKtP,
            that is when the QBP has not been exchanged for the opposing QP,
            but has pushed on to B5.</p>
          <p>In Diagrams 29 and 30 we see the chains of pawns formed by these
            manœuvres.</p>
          <p>White&rsquo;s pawn attack is more dangerous than Black&rsquo;s,</p>

            because it involves a direct assault on the King. And we shall
            see that Black will usually be compelled to suspend operations on
            the Queen&rsquo;s side temporarily, to ward off the storm by the</p>

            White Pawns on the King&rsquo;s side. He will attempt this either by P-
            KB3 attacking White&rsquo;s centre or by P-KB4 preventing White from
            playing P-B5. In the latter case White can only make a breach in
            the Black barrier by playing P-KKt4 as well. These manœuvres
            result in the pawn formations given in Diagrams 31 and 32.</p>

            on his third move, he prevents the Black KKt from reaching KB3,
            whence he might have moved to Q2. This is a desirable position,
            from which he could support the advance of P-QB4. But the Knight
            has other chances of development, to KR3 and B4, whence he can
            take his share in the attack on the White Pawn at Q4. In
            consequence White must postpone P-KB4 in order not to intercept
            the action of the QB on R6. Now, in that case White&rsquo;s Pawn at his
            K5 has not sufficient support against the attack by Black&rsquo;s P-KB3
            (Diagram 31), and the latter move gives Black the advantage. The
            two main variations illustrative of these considerations are:</p>
          <h5> I</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 3. P-K5 P-QB4
            4. P-QB3 Kt-QB3
            5. P-KB4 PxP
            6. PxP Q-Kt3
            7. Kt-KB3 Kt-R3</p>
          <h5> II</h5>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 3. P-K5 P-QB4
            4. P-QB3 Kt-QB3
            5. Kt-B3 P-B3</p>
          <p>In both cases the initiative falls to Black, in the first through
            the attack on White&rsquo;s Q4, the mainstay of White&rsquo;s centre; in the
            second through attack on White&rsquo;s K5, the White centre itself. We
            must therefore consider White&rsquo;s advance of P-K5 on the third move
            as premature. Let us now find out whether it is advantageous to
            effect the same subsequently. A developing move can be
            interpolated, e.g. 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3. If White plays P-K5 now he
            gains time for his advance of P-KB4, as Black&rsquo;s Knight must
            retreat. On the other hand he cannot now maintain his pawn at Q4,
            as he has blocked his QBP. We arrive at the following plan of
            development:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 3. Kt-QB3 Kt-KB3
            4. P-K5 KKt-Q2
            5. P-B4 P-QB4
            6. PxP Kt-QB3</p>
          <p>If Black were to play BxP at once, White could play Q-Kt4 with an
            attack on the Knight&rsquo;s Pawn. That is the object of Black&rsquo;s
            waiting move. White must either play 7. Kt-B3, which prevents his
            Q-Kt4, or 7. B-Q3, after which Black would take the pawn on B4
            with his Knight, getting rid of the White Bishop. 7. Q-Kt4 at
            once would be answered by P-B4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 7. Kt-B3 BxP
            8. B-Q3 P-B4</p>
          <p>Black cannot castle yet, on account of the following threat,
            which I give in full because it occurs frequently in practice:
            8. … Castles; 9. BxPch, KxB; 10. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Kt1: 11. Q-R5, R-
            K1; 12. QxPch; 13. Q-R5ch; 14. Q-R7ch; 15. Q-R8ch; 16. QxP mate.</p>

            <p class="caption">Diag. 33</p>
          </div>
          <p>The position in the diagram seems favourable to Black as White
            cannot castle for some time.</p>
          <p>For that reason another line of play has come to the fore in
            which White exchanges his inactive QB for Black&rsquo;s troublesome KB.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 3. Kt-QB3 Kt-KB3
            4. B-Kt5 B-K2

          </div>
          <p>White has now the choice of two lines of development. He can
            either prepare for P-QB3 to support his QP. or he can develop his
            King&rsquo;s side, holding the P at K5 only</p>

          </p>
          <p>The sacrifice BxPch, as mentioned above, was threatened.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 14. Castles Kt-R5
            15. R-Kt1 P-QKt4</p>
          <p>If White does not wish to lose so many moves with his Kt, he can
            effect the intended protection of his QP as follows:</p>
          <h5> 7. Q-Q2 P-QR3</h5>
          <p>not P-QB4 at once, because of Kt-Kt5.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 8. Kt-Q1 P-QB4

            10. Castles Kt-QB3
          </p>
          <p>and so on.</p>
          <p>In both cases White has an easy development, whilst Black has no
            convenient square for his Queen&rsquo;s Bishop.</p>
          <p>To avoid this drawback Rubinstein has evolved the following
            variation, in which provision is made from the first for the
            freedom of action of the Queen&rsquo;s Bishop:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 3. Kt-QB3 Kt-KB3
            4. B-Kt5 PxP</p>
          <p>to open the diagonal for the Bishop at QKt2, e.g.:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 5. KtxP QKt-Q2
            6. Kt-KB3 B-K2</p>
          <p>followed by P-QKt3 and B-Kt2.</p>
          <p>We will now leave the French defence and turn our attention to
            the Caro-Kann, of which the initial position was shown in Diagram
            28. Here also we find two essentially different systems of
            development, according to whether White plays P-K5 or gives Black
            the option of exchanging pawns by 3. Kt-QB3. In the first case a
            very noticeable difference from the French defence is, that Black
            can bring out his Queen&rsquo;s Bishop. Here the process of development
            may be:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 3. P-K5 B-B4
            4. B-Q3 BxB</p>
          <p>Not B-Kt3, because White could play P-K6! and paralyse the whole
            of Black&rsquo;s game by preventing his playing the King&rsquo;s Pawn.</p>
          <p> 5. QxB P-K3<br />
            6. Kt-K2 or KR3
          </p>
          <p>Through this the move P-KB4, which fits into this pawn formation,
            is kept in reserve.</p>
          <p>While White&rsquo;s development is easy and natural, Black has
            difficulty in finding good places for his King&rsquo;s side pieces.
            The game can proceed generally speaking on the lines of the
            French defence. Only Black can hardly attack White&rsquo;s centre with
            P-B3, since the Pawn at K3 would be weak in the absence of the
            Queen&rsquo;s Bishop. On the other hand, Black would be a move behind
            with an attack on the Queen&rsquo;s side, since to reach QB4 his pawn
            would have made two moves instead of one as in the French
            defence. A certain compensation lies in the fact that White&rsquo;s
            attacking King&rsquo;s Bishop has been exchanged.</p>
          <p>In practical play it has nevertheless been shown that White&rsquo;s
            attack is more likely to succeed, and for this reason a variation
            introduced by Niemzowitsch has been tried several times; it aims
            at the exchange of Queens in order to weaken and retard White&rsquo;s
            threatened attack, and to gain time for Queen&rsquo;s side operations.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 6. … Q-Kt3
            7. Castles Q-R3 or Kt4</p>
          <p>But after 8. Kt-B4, QxQ; 9. KtxQ, White is so much ahead with his
            development that Black&rsquo;s chance of equalising the game would seem
            questionable.</p>
          <p>If White plays Kt-KR3 on his sixth move, he foils at once Black&rsquo;s
            attempt of forcing an exchange of Queens, as he could play 8. Q-
            KKt3.</p>
          <p>On the whole we can conclude that in the Caro-Kann defence White
            obtains a good game by 3. P-K5.</p>
          <p>A line of play which used to be in vogue, namely, 3. Kt-QB3, PxP;
            4. KtxP, Kt-B3; 5. KtxKtch, KPxKt or KtPxKt, gives Black an even
            chance, for although he loses his centre pawn he obtains a good
            development, and later in the game he has opportunities of
            exercising pressure on White&rsquo;s QP through his open Q file.</p>
          <hr />
          <p>Except the French defence and the Caro-Kann, there is no game in
            which an irregular reply to White&rsquo;s 1. P-K4 necessitates any
            special considerations either in development of pieces or pawn
            formation. In all such cases it is sufficient to maintain the
            pawn centre and to occupy such squares with the pieces, whence
            they cannot be driven away with the loss of a move. Just one
            example: If Black plays 1. … P-QB4 (Sicilian defence), White
            will not play his King&rsquo;s Bishop to B4, because Black can reply P-
            K3, and gain a move by P-Q4.</p>
          <p>B. Let us now consider the openings in which the first move is 1.
            P-Q4 on either side. Here the centre cannot be cleared as early
            as in the openings beginning with 1. P-K4, P-K4. The advance of
            a second centre pawn, which there led to a clearance, is not
            feasible in this case. White does not command his K4, and for
            some time to come he will be unable to advance the K pawn beyond
            K3. In consequence the K file does not seem a likely opening for
            the Rooks, and another file must be found for them. The
            conclusions arrived at for Black in the French defence hold good
            for both sides in the opening now under consideration, and
            accordingly the QB file is that most advantageous for the Rooks.
            The advance of the QBP strikes at the opposing centre, and, that
            being of paramount importance, the Queen&rsquo;s Knight must not be
            developed at B3 before the QBP has been pushed on. Another
            development might be conceivable for the Rooks; viz. on the KB
            file, and also the KKt or KR file; here, as we shall see, an
            occasion may arise for storming the opposing King&rsquo;s side by a
            pawn attack. But in this case, too, although it seems unnecessary
            to play the QBP, it is advisable to develop the Knight via Q2, as
            there is a constant threat of the QB file being forced open
            subsequently by the opposing forces.</p>
          <p>We will start with the games in which the QB Pawns are played in
            the earliest stages of the opening, so that the pawn skeleton in
            Diagram 35 forms the basis of development. The sequence of moves
            is of moment, because the advance of the KP, whether forced or
            not, determines the possibility of bringing out the Q Bishops.
            The simplest process of development based on Diagram 35 is the
            following, in which both sides block up the QB.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

            6. B-Q3 B-Q3
            7. Castles. Castles</p>
          <p>The only useful square for the QB&rsquo;s on either side is now at Kt2,
            and 8. P-QKt3, P-QKt3 are indicated. To play P-QKt3 before
            castling is very dangerous, because Black can play PxQP and pin
            the White QKt with B-Kt5, forcing B-Q2, when B-Kt2 was the move
            intended, e.g. 6. P-QKt3, BPxP; 7. KPxP, B-Kt5; 8. B-Kt2, Kt-K5;
            9. Q-B2, Q-R4; 10. R-QB1, QxP.</p>
          <p>In order not to relinquish the square at QKt4 to Black, White can
            also try the following manœuvre:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 6. PxBP BxP
            7. P-QR3 Castles
            8. P-QKt4 B-Q3
            9. B-Kt2</p>
          <p>If Black imitates White&rsquo;s moves, viz. 9. … PxP; 10. BxP, P-QR3;
            11. Castles, P-QKt4; 12. B-Q3, B-Kt2, the result is the
            symmetrical position in Diagram 36.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

            <p class="caption">Diag. 36</p>
          </div>
          <p>When treating of the middle game, we shall find that even in this
            apparently fully equalised position the influence of the first
            move is still at work.</p>
          <p>In order to obtain a more thorough understanding of the Queen&rsquo;s
            Pawn game, we must now turn our attention very closely to the
            opening moves. Already on the second move White can play 2. P-QB4
            and turn the game into a Queen&rsquo;s gambit, which Black can either
            accept or decline. Black would be justified in playing 2. …
            PxP, and so furthering White&rsquo;s object of getting his (Black&rsquo;s)
            Queen&rsquo;s Pawn away, if he could permanently hold the gambit pawn,
            or if the giving up of the square at Q4 fits into a reasoned
            system of development. The latter was, for instance, the case in
            the play leading to the position shown in the Diagram 36. But
            Black is well advised to wait until White has moved the King&rsquo;s
            Bishop before taking the pawn on his QB5. This forces the Bishop
            to move twice, and Black regains the move he lost in his
            development, when he played PxP.</p>
          <p>It would be quite incorrect to try to hold the pawn by P-QKt4 as
            follows:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 2. P-QB4 PxP
            3. Kt-KB3 Kt-KB3
            4. P-K3 P-QKt4
            5. P-QR4</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag37.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 37</p>
          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            If now Black answers PxP, White simply plays BxP and the P at R5
            is lost very soon. If Black plays instead: 5. … P-B3, White
            wins back his pawn with 6. P-QKt3, PxKt P; 7. PxP, PxP; 8. BxPch
            by QxP, and moreover is much ahead with his development.</p>
          <p>These considerations point to the conclusion that after 2. P-QB4
            there is no inducement for Black to take the pawn. On the
            contrary, he will cover his centre pawn, which White wishes to
            tempt away, either with P-K3 or P-QB3. The attempt to develop the
            Queen&rsquo;s Bishop before playing P-K3 is not to be recommended,
            because the Q Kt&rsquo;s pawn remains unprotected and open to an
            immediate attack by 3. Q-Kt3. Of the two remaining replies, 2.
            … P-K3 and 2. … P-QB3, I will first discuss the former, as
            being the more natural of the two, since P-QB3 does not fit into
            the scheme for opening the QB file for the Rooks. White, on the
            other hand, can bring out his QB before playing P-K3, in this
            way:</p>
          <p>2. P-QB4, P-K3; 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3; 4. B-Kt5, and the game might
            proceed as follows: 4. … Q Kt-Q2. (Diagram 38.)</p>
          <p>No fault can be found with this move, although it blocks the
            Bishop, since the latter can only be developed effectively at
            Kt2. Moreover, the Knight at Q2 supports the projected P-B4.
            White cannot win a pawn now with 5. PxP, PxP; 6. KtxP, because of
            KtxKt; 7. BxQ, B-Kt5ch. Therefore 5. P-K3 must be played first,
            and after B-K2; 6. Kt-B3, Castles; 7. R-B1, P-QKt3; 8. PxP, PxP;
            9. B-Q3, B-Kt2, all the pieces have found rational development.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag38.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 38</p>
          </div>
          <p>Quite a different system of opening ensues, when Black does not
            delay pushing the P to QB4 until after his pieces are developed,
            but makes the advance on his third move.</p>
          <p>Here Black has the advantage of being able to avoid the pinning
            of his Knight by the opposing QB.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 2. P-QB4 P-K3

          <p>Now Black threatens QPxP with an attack on White&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Pawn.
            If White plays P-K3 we get the position mentioned in connection
            with Diagram 35. If he wishes to bring out his QB first, he must
            anticipate Black&rsquo;s threat by BPxP.</p>

            ensues, and is given in Diagram 39. Two continuations must now be
            considered. White can either develop his KB at Kt2, and
            concentrate on the Black QP, which is somewhat weak, or he can
            place the KB on one of the available squares between B1 and R6.
            In the first instance, the KP need not be played at all, and the
            QB</p>

          <p class="noindent">
            retains the option of developing at Kt5, B4, and even K3. In the
            second, where the K must make room for the KB, White must decide
            at once between B-B4 or Kt5, and only B4 can be seriously
            considered on account of</p>

            7. BxB KtxB</p>
          <p>which only furthers Black&rsquo;s development. White would only be
            justified in this course if he could now win a pawn with 8. PxP,
            but Black would win it back and have the superior game after</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 8. … P-Q5
            9. Kt-K4 Castles</p>
          <p>followed by B-B4 and Q-R4ch. The correct move in this variation
            is consequently 6. B-B4, and a possible continuation would be:
            Kt-KB3; 7. P-K3, B-K3; 8. R-QB1 or B-QKt5 or B-Q3.</p>
          <p>With this we will close the discussion of the variations
            initiated by 2. P-QB4, P-K3, and study the reply 2. … P-QB3.
            The first question which arises in our mind is: Which file will
            Black be able to utilise for his Rooks? An attempt to free the
            King&rsquo;s file through P-K4 is conceivable. But White can prevent
            this by simply playing Kt-KB3.</p>
          <p>Two other possibilities present themselves: after playing P-K3,
            Kt-B3 and QKt-Q2, Black could steer into a line similar to the
            Queen&rsquo;s gambit accepted with PxP and P-QB4, or he could keep the
            centre closed with P-KB4 and Kt-B3, with the intention of playing
            Kt-K5 and using the KB file for activating his Rook via KB3.
            Diagram 40 gives the position reached after:
          </p>
          <p> 3. Kt-KB3 P-K3<br />
            4. P-K3 Kt-KB4<br />

            <p class="caption">Diag. 40</p>
          </div>
          <p>White would not accomplish much with 6. P-KB4. The more or less
            symmetrical lineup of the pieces would most likely lead to a draw
            after Black properly prepares freeing his hemmed-in Bishop with
            P-QKt3 and B-Kt2. A better plan would be 6. P-B3, preventing Kt-
            K5 and preparing the eventual advance of the King&rsquo;s Pawn to K4.
            In reply to 6. … , QKt-Q2 White would then rather play 7. Kt-Q3
            than exchange Knights, as after this exchange it would not be too
            difficult for Black to bring his Bishop into play on the King&rsquo;s
            wing via K1. Both of White&rsquo;s Bishops would be best placed on Kt2.</p>
          <p>This &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; opening can also be played by White, who is then
            a move to the good in the variation just shown. But this opening
            has practically disappeared from modern tournament games, simply
            because the QB cannot easily be brought into play.</p>
          <p>The following variation is reminiscent of the &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; in the
            formation of the centre pawns. White develops his Queen&rsquo;s side
            just as Black did in the opening shown in connection with Diagram
            38.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            White can now settle his Knight at K5, and initiate a violent
            King&rsquo;s side attack after castling, by P-KB4, Q-B3, which could be
            continued with P-KKt4, K-R1, R-KKt1, and so on. Once the position
            in Diagram 41 has been reached, Black&rsquo;s resources against the
            dangerous onslaught of the White forces are scanty. Yet he can
            retaliate, not by making the simplest and most obvious developing
            moves, as mentioned before, but in the following way:</p>
          <p>If White plays 5. P-QKt3 before castling, Black exchanges pawns
            and checks with the Queen. Now White has the disagreeable choice
            between B-Q2 and P-B3. The former must be bad, being contrary to
            the plan of development as intended by P-QKt3. The latter blocks
            the very diagonal on which the Bishop was meant to operate.
            White can open up the diagonal by playing P-QB4 after castling,
            nor would it really imply the loss of a move to have played the
            BP twice, since Black must move his Queen again from R4, where
            she has no future. But in any case there remains the disadvantage
            that White was forced to play the BP, whilst before he had the
            option of withholding its advance until a more opportune moment.</p>
          <p>Another possible subtlety in Black&rsquo;s sequence of developing moves
            would be to withhold the advance of his KP until White has played
            P-QKt3, and then to play the QB to Kt5. For, as I have already
            remarked, the objection to developing Black&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Bishop lies
            in White&rsquo;s threat to attack Black&rsquo;s QKtP with Q-Kt3. That
            possibility disappears after P-QKt3.</p>
          <p>Before bringing the discussion of the Queen&rsquo;s Pawn opening to a
            close, I may remark that in tournaments it has become usual for
            White not to play P-QB4 at once, but to play Kt-KB3 as a
            preliminary, in order to avoid the complications of the Queen&rsquo;s
            counter gambit: 2. P-QB4, P-K4.</p>
          <p>If White plays 3. PxKP, Black&rsquo;s reply is P-Q5, and the obvious
            move 4. P-K3 fails on account of the following pretty
            combination: B—Kt5ch; 5. B—Q2, PxP; 6. BxB, PxPch; 7. K-K2,
            PxKtch!!; 8. RxKt, B-Kt5ch, etc.</p>
          <p>Instead of 4. P-K3, White should play P-KKt3 and develop his KB
            at Kt2. Black could now try to regain his pawn with Kt-K2-Kt3,
            but he can also sacrifice a pawn by P-KB3, with a view to rapid
            development.</p>
          <p>It now only remains for us to discover whether Black has any
            other answer to P-Q4 which would necessitate close analysis on
            White&rsquo;s part.</p>
          <p>Here must be mentioned: 1. … Kt-KB3, 1. … P-QB4, and 1. …
            P-KB4. The former move prepares P-Q3, followed by P-K4. In this
            opening there is no reason why White should play P-QB4, as there
            is no prospect of opening the QB file for the Rooks. Furthermore,
            Black has relinquished the square Q4 and made K4 the basis of
            operations. It will be more advisable to prevent Black from
            playing P-K4 as far as this can be achieved in conformity with a
            logical development, e.g. 1. P-Q4, Kt-KB3; 2. Kt-KB3. Not 2. Kt-
            QB3, because Black could then lead into the Queen&rsquo;s gambit by
            playing P-Q4 and P-QB4, after which White has the disadvantage of
            not being able to open the QB file. 2. … P-Q3; 3. B-B4, QKt-Q2;
            4. P-K3. Now Black can only enforce P-K4 after P-B3 and QB2.
            Meanwhile White mobilises all his pieces, whilst Black&rsquo;s QB
            remains blocked and the Kt must remain at Q2 to cover the KP. If,
            on the other hand, Black exchanges pawns in order to free the
            Knight, there is no Black centre left.</p>
          <p>With regard to the second irregular reply to 1. P-Q4, namely, 1.
            … P-QB4, two ways are open to White. One is to turn the opening
            into an ordinary Queen&rsquo;s gambit by playing P-K3, on which Black
            can play P-Q4. The second is to play 2. P-Q5. Black will then
            develop his King&rsquo;s side with P-KKt3 and B-Kt2. The Bishop is well
            posted here, and can frequently take up an attacking position at
            K4 or Q5. (See Game No. 45, Rubinstein v. Spielmann.)</p>
          <p>If White plays 2. PxP, we have after 2. … P-K3 a Queen&rsquo;s gambit
            accepted by White, and, as pointed out before, this line of play
            is not commendable.</p>
          <p>The last of the three irregular answers mentioned above: 1. …
            P-KB4 leads to two entirely different plans, according to the
            second move chosen by White.</p>
          <p>White can confine himself to a simple development such as: Kt-
            KB3, B-Kt5, P-K3, QKt-Q2 (Kt-B3 would only be good if preceded by
            P-B4, because Black would again lead into a Queen&rsquo;s gambit with
            P-Q4 and P-QB4). The other possibility is the following: in view
            of the fact that 1. … P-KB4 does absolutely nothing to aid
            development, White can initiate a violent attack by giving up his
            King&rsquo;s Pawn (P-K4) and thus accelerate his own development. The
            play might be as follows: 2. … PxP; 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3; 4. B-
            KKt5, P-B3 (P-Q4? 5. BxKt followed by Q-R5ch); 5. P-B3. If Black
            takes the pawn he lays himself open to an attack hard to meet. It
            seems best to play 5. … P-K6, which calls back the White QB and
            leaves White&rsquo;s BP as a hindrance to the development of the KKt.</p>
          <h3>IRREGULAR OPENINGS</h3>
          <p>
            Many openings in which neither P-K4 nor P-Q4 is the first move
            lead to well-known positions by a simple transposition of moves.
            For instance, a Queen&rsquo;s gambit may well have the following
            opening moves: 1. P-QB4, Kt-KB3; 2. Kt-KB3, P-K3; 3. Kt-B3, P-B4;
            4. P-K3, P-Q4; 5. P-Q4, or a French defence these: 1. Kt-QB3, P-
            Q4; 2. P-Q4, Kt-KB3; 3. B-Kt5, P-K3; 4. P-K4.</p>
          <p>There are, of course, systems of opening which deviate absolutely
            from those which have been proved sound and are in general use,
            and it is those openings that puzzle the beginner most of all. He
            says: What is the good of learning correct openings, if my
            opponent plays incorrectly and wins all the same? This line of
            thought is wrong from its inception. The student is not supposed
            to &ldquo;learn&rdquo; openings by heart, but to UNDERSTAND how the general
            principles of Chess Strategy are applied to any opening. Such
            knowledge can never be obtained from a tabulated analysis, but
            can only be arrived at by the application of common sense. If a
            player succeeds in winning in spite of an inferior opening, it
            only proves that subsequently he has played a stronger game than
            his opponent, who, after playing the opening according to the
            book, did not know how to proceed further. And herein lies the
            weakness, and not in the absence of knowledge of the analysis of
            openings. The latter is rated far too highly. Any player will
            hold his own in the opening, as soon as he has grasped the real
            meaning of those principles which I cannot repeat often enough,
            viz.: 1st, quick development of pieces and avoidance of lost
            moves; 2nd, the maintenance of a pawn centre, hampering the
            development of the opposing forces, and the avoidance of pawn
            moves that do not contribute to the development of pieces.</p>
          <p>How to conduct the middle game and end-game is not entirely a
            matter of deduction from such general rules. In order to play the
            end-game correctly, one must know certain things and positions
            which arise from and may be said to be peculiar to the purely
            arbitrary rules of chess. The same applies to the middle game, as
            in most cases it must be played with a view to the end-game which
            ensues, unless there be a chance of mating the opponent before.
            The student should have, therefore, a knowledge of the end-game
            before he can hope to be able to conduct the middle game
            efficiently. For this reason I have decided to treat of the end-
            game first.</p>

            THE END-GAME</h2>
          <p>JUST as it is difficult to state the exact point at which an
            opening ends, so is it equally difficult to say where the end-
            game may be said to commence. One of the main characteristics of
            end-games is the active part taken by the King. Clearly the King
            cannot venture out into the field of operations until there has
            been an exchange of the majority of the pieces, so that there can
            be no danger of his being mated. As soon as a player has attained
            some advantage in material which ensures the victory in the end-
            game, he will try to bring about the end-game by exchanging
            pieces, for there the lines on which to push home his advantage
            are clearly set out.</p>
          <p>It is first necessary to know what surplus of forces is the
            minimum required in order to force a mate. The positions in which
            the mate can be forced may be shown by a few typical examples.
            But I shall lay stress mainly on one point. That is the ability
            to judge whether an end-game which could be brought about by
            exchanges is won or not; in other words, whether it can be
            reduced to one of the typical positions referred to above.</p>
          <p>It is obvious that the end-game is the particular demesne of pawn
            strategy. Nearly always one or more pawns survive the exchange of
            pieces, and the knowledge of the end-game will be invaluable for
            gauging the consequences of pawn moves in the course of the
            middle game. The latter represents probably the most difficult
            aspect of the strategy of chess.</p>
          <p>In order to enable beginners to grasp the following chapters, I
            must again point out a few elementary considerations.</p>
          <p>Simple end-games, that is, end-games without pawns, are
            comparatively easy to understand. Let us first consider the case
            of a King denuded of all his troops. In order to force the mate
            it is necessary to obtain command of four squares, namely, those
            four squares which he controls after he has been driven into a
            corner. Supposing the Black King has been driven to QR1, the
            White King can prevent him from reaching two squares of different
            colour, namely, QR2 and QKt2. Therefore it is necessary for White
            still to have such forces as can command two more squares of
            different colour, namely, QR1 and QKt1. As can readily be seen,
            it will be essential to have at least the Queen or a Rook or two
            Bishops, or a Knight and Bishop, or two Knights. [Footnote: How
            the King can be driven into a corner will be shown subsequently.]</p>
          <p>We shall see that in the latter case it is impossible to drive
            the King into a corner without bringing about a stalemate. The
            mates by a Queen or Rook are so simple that I only give an
            example of each for the sake of completeness.</p>
          <p> Position 1.—White: K at QR1, Q-KR1<br />
            Black: K at K4
          </p>
          <p> 1. K-Kt2, K-Q5; 2. K-Kt3, K-K4; 3. K-B4, K-Q3; 4. Q-K4, K-
            Q2; 5. K-B5, K-B1; 6. K-B6, K-Kt1; 7. Q-QR4, or Kt4ch, or K7, or
            R7 and mate next move.</p>
          <p> Position 2.—White: K at QKt3, RKR2<br />
            Black: K at K4
          </p>
          <p> 1. K-B4, K-Q3; 2. R-K2, K-B3; 3. R-K6ch, K-Q2; 4. K-Q5, K-
            B2; 5. K-B5, K-Q2; 6. R-K1, K-B2; 7. R-K7ch, K-Q1; 8. K-Q6, K-B1;
            9. K-B6, K-Kt1; 10. R-K1, K-R7; 11. R-K8, K-R3; 12. R-R8 mate.</p>
          <p> Position 3.—White: K at QRsq, B at KKtsq, BatKKt2<br />
            Black: K at KRsq
          </p>
          <p>1. K-Kt2, K-Kt2; 2. K-B3, K-B3; 3. K-Q4, K-K3; 4. B-R2, K-
            B3; 5. K-Q5, K-B4; 6. B-K5, K-Kt4; 7. K-K6, K-Kt5; 8. B-
            QR8, K-Kt4; 9. B-B3, K-Kt3; 10. B-KB6, K-R3; 11. K-B7, K-
            R2; 12. B-Kt5, K-R1; 13. B-Q1, K-R2; 14. B-B2ch, K-R1;
            B-B6 mate.
          </p>
          <p>It is more difficult to mate with KNIGHT AND BISHOP. It is only
            possible to mate on a corner square commanded by the Bishop, as
            the following argument shows clearly. A mating position in the
            corner which the Bishop does not command would have to be of the
            type set out in Diagram 42. Here the Bishop plays on White
            squares, and the Knight in order to checkmate must move on to a
            White square; in other words, he must come from a Black one.
            Therefore, when the Bishop checked on the previous move and drove
            the King away, the King had the option of two black squares, and
            had no need to go into the corner one. He is only mated in

            As stated above, however, it is possible in all cases to mate
            in the corner square which is of the same colour as the Bishop.
            The King is driven into the corner in this way: the Knight cuts
            him off such squares as the Bishop does not command. Diagram 43

          <p>It is impossible to force a mate with the KING AND TWO KNIGHTS.
            On the same grounds as given with respect to Diagram 42, the mate
            can only be attained through the opponent making a bad move. But
            a mate can be forced if the weaker side has a spare move which
            prevents the stalemate, e.g. Diagram 44.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p>Having decided as to the smallest amount of material advantage
            with which it is possible to force a mate, we will now turn our
            attention to simple game endings (still without pawns). To judge
            such endings correctly, it will only be necessary to find out
            whether it is possible to obtain the minimum advantage mentioned.
            It is sufficient to discuss cases in which a piece on the one
            side plays against a stronger one on the other, because in
            endings where several pieces are left on either side, fortuitous
            circumstances are generally the deciding factors, and it would be
            impossible to characterise and classify positions of that kind,
            by giving typical illustrations. Besides, they are reduced
            sooner or later by exchanges to such end-games as have been
            treated already, or are going to be shown now.</p>
          <p>The Queen wins against any other piece; the Rook alone may give
            trouble. In Diagram 45 we illustrate a</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p class="noindent">
            position which is one of the most favourable to the weaker side.</p>
          <p>1. Q-R6 leads to nothing, as R-B2ch follows, and after 2. K-Kt6
            Black forces a stalemate with R-B3ch.</p>
          <p>It is necessary for White to gain a move in this position; in
            other words, White must try to transfer to the other side the
            onus of having to move. If then the Rook moves away from the
            King, it gets lost after a few checks, or if Black&rsquo;s King plays
            to B1, the Rook is equally lost through Q-R6.</p>
          <p>White plays therefore: 1. Q-K5ch, K-R1; 2. Q-R1ch, K-Kt1; 3. Q-
            R5, and wins. For example, 3. … R-B2; 4. Q-K5ch, K-R2; 5. Q-
            K3ch, K-R1; 6. Q-K8ch, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>The Rook can win against a minor piece in exceptional cases only.
            In endings of ROOK AGAINST BISHOP the weaker King must take
            refuge in a corner square of different colour from that of his
            Bishop. For instance, Diagram 46:
          </p>

            unless the Rook leaves the eighth Rank. Any outside square which
            is not of the same colour as that of the Bishop is dangerous for
            the King. Imagine the pieces in Diagram 46 shifted two squares
            towards the centre of the board, as in Diagram 47, and White wins
            with</p>

            3. R-R8</p>
          <p>The Bishop is lost, as it is Black&rsquo;s move.</p>
          <p>In endings of ROOK AGAINST KNIGHT, the weaker side loses, where
            the Knight is cut off from his King.</p>
          <p>For instance, in Diagram 48, 1. R-Q5! In this &ldquo;oblique
            opposition&rdquo; the Rook takes four of the Knight&rsquo;s squares: 1. …
            Kt-K8; 2. K-B5, Kt-B7; 3. K-K4, Kt-R6 (Kt-Kt5?; 4. R-Kt5ch! wins
            the Knight). In this ending there is always a fatal check at some
            point, and the position in the</p>

          <p>We come now to the more interesting part of end-game play,
            namely, PAWN ENDINGS. The best course will be first to study how
            to turn a material superiority in pawns to decisive advantage,
            after which we shall note particular positions, in which a win is
            possible with an equality or even an inferiority in pawns.</p>
          <p>The ending of KING AND PAWN AGAINST KING is one of the simplest
            albeit one of the most important of elementary cases. The
            stronger side will evidently try to queen the pawn. But generally
            this is not possible if the adverse King has command of the
            queening square. One important condition, though, must be
            complied with: the weaker King must move into &ldquo;opposition,&rdquo; and
            &ldquo;opposition&rdquo; is one of the characteristic and deciding factors in
            most pawn endings. It is absolutely necessary for the learner to
            understand fully the meaning of the term &ldquo;opposition,&rdquo; and its
            value in elementary cases This knowledge is of far reaching
            influence in end-games.</p>

          <p>In Diagram 49 White seeks to queen his pawn.</p>
          <h5> 1. K-Q4, K-K2; 2. K-K5</h5>
          <p>With this move White assumes the opposition. That is, he moves
            into the same rank or file, separated by one square only, so
            that both Kings stand on squares of the same colour. White has
            moved last, it is Black&rsquo;s turn to move; it is said in this case
            that &ldquo;White has the opposition.&rdquo; We shall soon see that Black is
            only able to draw the game, if he succeeds in assuming the
            opposition himself (which means that, having the move, he should
            step into opposition). 2. … K-Q 2; 3 P-Q6 (Diagram 50).</p>

            <p class="caption">Diag. 50</p>
          </div>
          <p>I propose now to recapitulate.</p>
          <p>This is the critical moment, namely, when the pawn reaches the
            sixth rank. If now Black plays K-K1 he is lost, for White playing
            K-K6 has the opposition. After 4. … K-Q1, 5. P-Q7, Black is
            forced to allow the White King to move to K7, covering the
            queening square; 5. … K-B2, 6. K-K7, any; 7. P queens. But
            Black has a draw in the position of Diagram 50, by playing 3. …
            K-Q1!! (not K1). Now after 4. K-K6 he keeps the opposition
            himself with K-K1; and after 5. P-Q7ch, K-Q1; 6. K-Q6, he is
            stalemated, or else wins the pawn if White plays differently on
            his sixth move. The King draws against King and pawn if he
            commands the queening square, and if he can retain the opposition
            on the first rank as soon as the pawn moves into his sixth.</p>
          <p>It is of the utmost importance that the pawn should be at his
            sixth; if the pawn is still further back, the opposition on the
            first rank is of no avail.</p>
          <p>Diagram 51 will serve as an example. Having the move,</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            White would only draw with P-B5, because Black&rsquo;s K-B2 wins the
            pawn.</p>
          <p>But White wins as follows: 1. K-Kt6, K-B1; 2. K-B6, K-K1; 3. K-

            5. P-B5, K-Q sq. We see: Black has just assumed the opposition,
            but the pawn has not yet crossed to his sixth square, and White,
            by playing P-B6, again forces Black to give up the opposition. It
            might be more clear to put it in this way: with P-B6 White wins
            the opposition, in that he brings about a position with Black to
            move. Therefore the game is won for White. Since the opposition
            on the outside rank is of no avail, when the pawn has not yet
            played to his sixth square, the weaker side must try to keep away
            the opposing King from the sixth rank until the pawn has reached
            that rank. This is possible in positions such as that in Diagram
            53, where the stronger</p>

          <p class="noindent">
            King is not more than one rank ahead of his pawn, and the weaker
            King can assume the opposition. In the position in Diagram 53
            Black plays K-Q4 and maintains the opposition until the pawn
            moves, after which a typical position, similar to the one treated
            in connection with Diagram 50 is brought about.</p>
          <p>If White has the move, however, he wins easily by 1. K-B4, thus:</p>

          <p>and there is opposition on the eighth rank whilst the pawn has
            not reached the sixth.</p>
          <p>If the King is more than one rank ahead of his pawn, as in
            Diagram 54, the end-game can always be won, for if Black

            takes the opposition with K-Q3, White deprives him of it again,
            winning a move by P-B3, and the position is similar to that in

          <p>This settles all typical end-games of King and pawn against King.
            There is, however, one exception to the rules set out, namely,
            when a ROOK&rsquo;S PAWN is concerned. Here the isolated King always
            succeeds in drawing if he can reach the corner where the pawn has
            to queen, for he cannot be driven out again. The Rook&rsquo;s pawn
            affords another opportunity for the weaker side to draw. Diagram
            55 will illustrate this, and similar positions are of frequent
            occurrence in practice. Here Black draws with 1. … K-B5. As he
            threatens to capture the pawn, White must play 2. P-R4. Then
            after the reply K-B4, White is still unable to cut the opponent
            off from the corner with K-Kt7, as the loss of the pawn is still
            threatened through K-Kt5. And after 3. P-R5 Black attains the
            position which is typical for this end-game, namely the
            opposition against the King on the Rook&rsquo;s file. The latter cannot
            escape without giving up the contested corner, and the game is
            drawn. 3. … K-B3; 4. K-R7, K-B2; 5. K-R8, K-B1; 6. P-R6, K-B2;
            7. P-R7, K-B1: and White is stalemated.</p>

          <p>End-games with a majority of one pawn, when both sides still have
            pawns, are much more simple to manipulate.</p>
          <p>Such games result in positions of which Diagram 56 is a</p>

            typical instance. Here White does not even need to Queen his
            passed pawn. The mere threat forces the win. For the pawn at Kt4
            reduces the mobility of the Black King, in so far as the latter
            must at all times be ready to reach the queening square in as few
            moves as the pawn, or else the pawn would queen unmolested. The
            White King can therefore capture the opposing Bishop&rsquo;s pawn in
            peace and then queen his own.</p>
          <p>1. K-K4, K-K3; 2. P-Kt5, K-K2; 3. K-K5, K-B2; 4. K-Q6, and so on;

            so on.</p>
          <p>Such positions as Diagram 56 are also reached when there are
            several pawns on each wing. The stronger side exchanges pawns on
            the wing where there is a majority until the extra pawn is
            passed.</p>
          <p>The winning process is not quite so simple when all the pawns are
            on the same wing, because exchanges are of no use unless the King
            can assume the opposition in front of the last remaining pawn
            (compare notes to Diagram 53).</p>
          <p>In Diagram 57, for instance, White must not play P-B4. Therefore
            he can only win by gaining the Knight&rsquo;s Pawn,</p>

            that is, by bringing his King to B5. This he achieves by forcing
            the Black King to relinquish the opposition with 1. P-B3.</p>

          <p>This position, being of frequent occurrence, is most important,
            and I recommend it as a valuable study in the use of the
            opposition.</p>
          <p>Before I discuss positions of greater complexity, in which the
            only way to win is by sacrificing the extra pawn, I shall treat
            of end-games in which positional advantages ensure the victory
            although the pawns are equal. Here we shall find simple cases in
            which pawn manœuvres bring about the win, and more intricate
            ones in which King moves are the deciding factor.</p>
          <p>Of the former the most important type is the end-game with the
            &ldquo;distant passed pawn.&rdquo; A typical example is the position in
            Diagram 58, in which Black wins.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The King&rsquo;s moves are outlined by the necessity of capturing the
            opposing passed pawn, after which the Black King is two files
            nearer the battle-field (the Queen&rsquo;s side), so that the White
            pawns must fall.</p>
          <p>1. K-Kt2, K-Kt2; 2. K-Kt3, K-B3; 3. K-Kt4, K-K4; 4. P-B4ch, K-B3;
            5. K-Kt3, P-R4; 6. K-R4, K-B4; 7. KxP, KxP; 8. K-Kt6, K-K4, and
            so on.</p>
          <p>For similar reasons the position in Diagram 59 is lost for Black.
            White obtains a passed pawn on the opposite wing to that of the
            King. He forces the Black King to abandon his King&rsquo;s side pawns,
            and these are lost. I give the moves in full, because this is
            another important example characteristic of the ever recurring
            necessity of applying our arithmetical rule. By simply
            enumerating the moves necessary for either player to queen his
            pawn—SEPARATELY for White and Black—we can see the result of
            our intended manœuvres, however far ahead we have to extend our
            calculations.</p>
          <p> 1. P-R4, K-K3; 2. P-R5, PxP; 3. PxP, K-Q3</p>
          <p>Now the following calculations show that Black is lost. White
            needs ten moves in order to queen on the King&rsquo;s side, namely,
            five to capture the Black King&rsquo;s side pawns (K-K4, B5, Kt6, R6,
            Kt5), one to free the way for his pawn, and four moves with the
            pawn. After ten moves, Black only</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p class="noindent">
            gets his pawn to B6. He requires six moves to capture the White
            Queen&rsquo;s side pawns, one to make room for his pawn at B3, and
            after three moves the pawn only gets to B6. White then wins by
            means of many checks, forcing the Black King to block the way of
            his own pawn, thus gaining time for his King to approach. As we
            shall see later on (p. 97), if the pawn had already reached B7,
            whilst under protection by his K, the game would be drawn.</p>
          <p>It is necessary to make it a rule to examine positions in which
            each side has a passed pawn, by counting the moves in the way
            first shown. It is just because end-games can be calculated to a
            nicety, there being no moves of which the consequences cannot be
            foreseen, that we note in contemporary master play a tendency to
            simplify the middle-game by exchanging pieces, as soon as there
            is an infinitesimal advantage in the pawn position (compare the
            game Charousek-Heinrichsen, p. 108).</p>
          <p>We will now turn our attention to positions in which the pawns
            opposed on each wing are of equal number and no passed pawn can
            be forced through. Everything depends on the relative position of
            the Kings. The deciding factor in valuing the King&rsquo;s position is
            whether pawn moves are possible, or whether they are already
            entirely or nearly exhausted, so that only manœuvres by the King
            are possible. The following illustrations make the position
            clear. We shall see that the importance of getting the opposition
            is paramount. Diagram 60 shows a simple instance in which there
            are no</p>

            more pawn moves. Whoever has the move wins by assuming the
            opposition. The opposing King must then give the way free to one
            of the pawns.</p>
          <p>The state of affairs in Diagram 61 is similar to that in Diagram
            60. Having the move, White plays into opposition and forces his
            way to Q5, after which Black&rsquo;s Bishop&rsquo;s pawn is lost.</p>
          <p>1. K-K4, K-Q3; 2. K-B5, K-Q2; 3. K-K5, K-B3; 4. K-K6, K-B2; 5. K-
            Q5, K-Kt3; 6. K-Q6, and so on (compare Diagram 57). If Black has
            the move he can only draw, because the White Bishop&rsquo;s pawn is
            covered even though Black gains the square at Q5.</p>
          <p>1. … K-K4; 2. K-Q3, K-B5; 3. K-Q2!! and whatever Black plays
            White wins the opposition, so that the Black King&rsquo;s ingress is
            stopped; 2. K-K2 loses the game because of 3. … K-K5; 4. K-Q2,
            K-Q5; 5. K-B2, K-K6; 6. K-B1, K-Q6; 7. K-Kt2, K-Q7; 8. K-Kt1, K-

            <p class="caption">Diag. 61</p>
          </div>
          <p>I shall take this opportunity of explaining what is called
            &ldquo;distant opposition.&rdquo; In Diagram 62, White with the move wins by
            1. K-K2, thus assuming &ldquo;distant opposition&rdquo; (squares of the same
            colour!!). If Black now enters his second rank, White immediately
            plays into opposition on his third rank, e.g. 1. … K-Q2; 2. K-
            Q3, and still maintains it by 3. K-K3 if Black plays a waiting
            move such as 2. … K-K2. Now Black has no further waiting moves,
            as White threatens to capture one of the pawns. But playing into
            the third rank is of no use, as White then assumes the direct
            opposition, and wins as in Diagram 60. Black must allow White
            access to one side or the other. He could not have remained on
            the first rank at the outset either, for after 1. … K-Q1, White
            advances through a square, to which Black cannot assume the
            opposition, namely, 2. K-B3. If now Black wishes to answer the
            threat of K-B 4-Kt5 and plays K-K2, White answers 3. K-K3 as
            before.</p>
          <p>2. K-K3 or KQ3 would be wrong, as Black would then succeed in
            assuming the opposition at K2 or Q2, and would be able to
            maintain it. White would be unable to circumvent this or to
            attack the pawns.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag62.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 62</p>
          </div>
          <p>In this position, too, there is ample scope for the study of the
            opposition.</p>
          <p>If the pawns are still standing behind, the King who has the most
            advanced position has always the advantage, because he threatens
            to attack the opposing pawns should they leave their base. White
            has more pawn moves at his disposal, and will nearly always
            succeed in assuming the opposition. For instance, in Diagram 63,
            White, having the move, wins because his King gets first into the
            centre of the board.</p>
          <p>1. K-K3, K-Q2; 2. K-B4, K-K2; 3. K-Kt5 K-B2; 4. K-R6, K-Kt1; 5.
            P-KB4, K-R1; 6. P-B5, PxP; 7. K-Kt5, K-Kt2; 8. KxP, K-B2. Black
            has now the opposition but cannot maintain it, having no pawn
            moves available. The White King threatens to capture any pawn
            that ventures forward.</p>
          <p>9. K-K5, K-K2; 10. K-Q5, K-Q2; 11. P-B4, P-B3ch; 12. K-K5, K-K2;
            13. P-B5, and wins, as Black will soon be compelled to play K-Q2,
            after which a manœuvre shown previously gives White the Queen&rsquo;s
            Bishop&rsquo;s pawn.</p>

            17. K-K6, and so on.</p>
          <p>If in Diagram 63 the King stood at Q2 instead of B1, he could
            just manage to draw. White takes eleven moves to capture the
            Black King&rsquo;s side pawns, and to queen one of</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p class="noindent">
            his own, as can be easily seen. In eleven moves Black captures
            the opposing QBP and queens his own. We see here how the King&rsquo;s
            position can be counterbalanced by the weakness of a pawn, and
            lead to a draw. If the White QBP was not isolated but standing,
            for instance, at QKt2, Black would be lost, as calculation easily
            shows.</p>
          <p>The strength or weakness of a pawn position, which, as we saw,
            had so deciding an influence in the end-game position just
            treated, is one of the most important factors in a game of chess,
            and should have full consideration in the middle game. A pawn,
            when isolated, is naturally weaker than when it is or can be
            protected by another. It may easily lead to the loss of a game,
            as the mobility of the King or a piece is reduced by having to
            protect the pawn (compare End-game, p. 102).</p>
          <p>It is frequently and erroneously thought that DOUBLED pawns as
            such are a weakness. Doubled pawns are weak when ISOLATED, for
            they cannot support each other. But if doubled pawns can be
            supported by a pawn on the next file they need not by any means
            be at a disadvantage against three united single pawns on the
            opposite side. For instance, in Diagram 64, if Black had a pawn
            at QKt3 instead of R2, White would have no winning chances. He
            could not attack the pawns, nor would any kind of manœuvres
            force a passed pawn through. In the diagram, however, White wins
            through</p>

          <p>In this particular case the win is made easy by the fact that the
            White King is able to attack the Black pawn at once. But even
            without this advantage, the weakness of</p>

          <p class="noindent">
            doubled pawns usually entails the loss of the game. Diagram 65
            may serve as an example.</p>

            5. K-B4, and wins.</p>
          <p>Doubled pawns are a drawback, even when not isolated, should
            there be no way of obtaining a passed pawn by exchanging them
            against a smaller number of single pawns. This is illustrated in
            Diagram 66, in which Black wins because the three pawns on the
            King&rsquo;s side hold up the four White pawns and the Black King can
            assail the White pawns from the rear,</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

            the White King being fettered by the necessity of capturing the
            QBP. The proper formation for the Black pawns would be at B3,
            Kt2, R3, after which White cannot force a pawn through by playing
            P-B4 and P-Kt5, as Black can refrain from making any exchange.
            Black could not afford to leave the pawns where they are, because
            even if there were no White pawn at B2, White would, by playing
            P-Kt5, threaten to win in the following way:</p>
          <p>1. P-Kt6, BPxP; 2. P-R6, and P-B6, etc.; or 1. … RPxP; 2. P-
            B6, with P-R6, etc. In a game Ed. Lasker-Moll (Berlin
            championship, 1904), from which the position is taken, Black
            played P-R3 in order to obtain the formation mentioned above, and
            White resigned after 2. P-B4? P-B3, P-Kt5, K-Q5. There was,
            however, a pretty win after Black&rsquo;s P-R3, namely: 2. P-B6, PxP;

            B2 and Black is lost, because his own pawn obstructs the square
            B2, and the King must release the square Kt2, after which the
            White pawn queens.</p>
          <p>This winning combination, however, is only an interesting
            exception to the rule that positions of this kind are generally
            won by the side which possesses the passed pawn. In this
            particular case Black could have made the position secure by
            obtaining the ideal position of B3 Kt2 R3 for his pawns earlier,
            before the White pawns could advance so far. In the position of
            Diagram 66 Black could still have won by playing P-B3. After 2.
            P-R6, PxP; 3. P-B4, K-Q4; the Black King has time to overtake the
            passed pawn which results on the Bishop&rsquo;s file.</p>
          <p>To conclude the study of pawn endings with an equal number of
            pawns on either side, we will discuss Diagram 67,</p>

            which illustrates a curious position occurring from time to time
            in practice. Whoever has the move wins by moving into distant
            opposition. White, therefore, should play K-K5 K-Q5 would lose,
            as Black would play K-Kt5, protecting his pawn and attacking the
            White pawn, the protection of which White has to give up next
            move. In the same way Black with the move cannot play K-Kt5
            because White wins the pawn with K-Q5. After 1. K-K5 Black cannot
            avoid the loss of the game, e.g. K-R3; 2. K-Q5, K-Kt3; 3. K-Q6,
            and so on. Black with the move wins similarly with K-R5.</p>
          <p>We have still to consider end-games in which a draw results in
            spite of a majority of pawns, or where a win can only be achieved
            by the sacrifice of an extra pawn.</p>
          <p>Diagram 68 shows the latter case. Here White can only win in the

            could win by simply assuming the opposition with 1. K-K4

            pawn endings are of no avail, as far as opposition is concerned,
            as the advantage of opposition means that the opponent is forced
            to move his King, and as long as there are pieces on the board,
            such &ldquo;forced move&rdquo; positions are infrequent. However, the
            strength of the pawn position is of the same importance as in
            pawn endings, just as the command of as many squares as possible
            is essential for the King. A third and very important factor is
            again the mobility of pieces.</p>
          <p>A good example is found in Diagram 70, a position from a game
            Post-Leonhardt (Berlin Jubilee Tournament, 1907).

          <p>Black&rsquo;s pawn position is weaker, because the White pawns, being
            on Black squares, cannot be attacked by the Bishop, whilst Black
            has two isolated pawns on White squares. Furthermore the Black
            Bishop has less mobility than the White one, and finally the
            Black King is tied to his Q3, to prevent White&rsquo;s entry at B5 or
            K5. These drawbacks decide the issue. 1. … B-R2; 2. P-R4, B-
            Kt3; 3. B-B2, P-R4. (After B-R2 White would command the square at
            Kt6 through P-R5); 4. B-Q3, B-R2; 5. B-B1, and Black resigns, for
            White threatens to establish his Bishop at B3, where the pawns at
            Q5 and R5 are both attacked, whilst the Black Bishop is at once
            forced to occupy the only square from which both pawns are
            covered, namely B2. As this square must be abandoned in the next
            move, Black loses a pawn and the game.</p>
          <p>5. … B-Kt1; 6. B-K2, B-B2; 7. B-B3, and wins, or 5. … B-Kt3;
            6. B-Kt2, B-B2; 7. B-B3, and wins.</p>
          <p>A corresponding instance of KNIGHT V. BISHOP is the end-game
            Blackburne-Schlechter (p. 102).
          </p>
          <p>It is difficult to gauge the relative value of Bishop and Knight
            in the end-game. The Knight has the advantage of access to all
            squares; against that the Bishop is able to fight at long range,
            and offers opportunities of gaining moves in certain positions
            where there is a &ldquo;forced move&rdquo; (compare p. 90).</p>
          <p>As already stated, two Bishops are superior to two Knights
            because the limitation of the colour of squares ceases. A Rook
            generally wins against a Bishop or a Knight, sometimes even
            against a majority of one or two pawns, provided, of course, that
            there are still pawns on the Rook&rsquo;s side, and that their exchange
            cannot be forced. The following position (Diagram 71), from a
            game Moll-Post, shows how to proceed in such cases.</p>
          <p>Here White can force a win in the following way: 1. RxP, P-Kt6;
            2. R-R6, PxP; 3. RxP, K-B2; 4. R-B2, B-Kt5; 5. R-B4, B-R4; 6. P-
            B4! The Black pawn position must first be torn up, if it is to be
            attacked successfully.</p>
          <p>Now Black&rsquo;s defeat is inevitable, whether the pawn is taken or
            not. The sequel would be 6. … PxP; 7. RxP, after which the Rook
            goes to KR5 and the Rook&rsquo;s pawn must fall, or: 6. … K-Kt3; 7.
            PxP, PxP; 8. R-B6ch, K-Kt2; 9. R-B5, and the Bishop&rsquo;s pawn is
            lost, unless Black gives up his passed pawn. In this case Black
            loses also: 9. R-B5, B-Q1; 10. KxP, K-Kt3; 11. K-Q3, B-B3; 12. R-
            B6, K-Kt2; 13. K-K4, K-Kt3; 14. R-R6, K-B2; 15. K-B5, B-Q1; 16.
            R-KKt6, followed by RxP, etc.</p>
          <p>The Queen against a minor piece wins so easily that it is not
            necessary to give an example. It only remains to discuss end-</p>

            recurring in practice to which I must refer specially.</p>
          <p>Diagram 72 shows an end-game with a Rook&rsquo;s pawn and a Bishop &ldquo;of
            the wrong colour.&rdquo;</p>
          <p>White draws with 1. Kt-Q2, P-B7; 2. Kt-K4ch, K-Kt7; 3. KtxP, and
            draws, as Black, in order to capture the White pawn, after KxKt
            must give the White King access to the Rook&rsquo;s square, from which
            he could not be dislodged except by a Bishop on White squares.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 73 White cannot win although his Bishop is of the
            &ldquo;right colour&rdquo; by 1. P-B7, KtxP; 2. BxKt, and White cannot win
            the Rook&rsquo;s pawn. He can only attack the pawn from Kt7 or Kt8,
            both of which are inaccessible as the Black King gets to Kt1. It
            is a stalemate position. If the White</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

            pawn were still at R5, White&rsquo;s King could attack the pawn from R6
            and secure the win.</p>
          <p>In the position given, White could only win by keeping his passed
            pawn, and indeed it is possible to win by gaining a move with the
            Bishop. In the diagram it is White&rsquo;s move. Black with the move
            could not play K-B2 because K-Q6 would follow. The Knight would
            have to move, allowing the pawn to queen. Therefore White must
            try to bring about the same position with Black to move. He can
            do this, for instance, in the following way:</p>
          <p>1. B-Kt3, K-B2 (now 2. K-Q6 would be bad on account of Kt-Q5, 3.
            P-B7, Kt-Kt5ch, and KtxP); 2. B-R2, K-K2; 3. B-K5. Now White&rsquo;s
            plan has succeeded; the same position has occurred, and it is
            Black&rsquo;s move. As mentioned before, the King must not move, but
            Knight&rsquo;s moves are of no avail. If 3. … Kt-Kt4; 4. B-B6ch, the
            Knight is lost, or alternatively the pawn queens. On 3. … Kt-
            B1, B-Q6ch decides, and on 3. … Kt-Q1; 4. B-B6ch, K-K1; 5. BxKt
            would follow.</p>
          <p>On this occasion I should like to point out that it is impossible
            to gain a move with a Knight, as a square which is accessible to
            him in an odd number of moves cannot be reached by him in an even
            number. A simple instance is Diagram 74.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag74.jpg" width="400" height="399" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 74</p>
          </div>
          <p>White loses, having the move. 1. K-R8, Kt-K4; 2. K-R2, Kt-Q2; 3.
            K-R8, Kt-B1; 4. P-R7, Kt-Kt3 mate.
          </p>
          <p>Black with the move cannot win, as he cannot bring about the same
            position with White to move.</p>
          <p>In end-games of BISHOP V. BISHOP, of which we have already had an
            example in Diagram 70, an extra pawn wins in most cases if the
            Bishops are of the same colour. It is generally possible to force
            an exchange of Bishops and obtain one of the well-known pawn
            endings.</p>
          <p>On the other hand an ending with Bishops of different colour
            leads mostly to a draw, frequently even against a majority of two
            pawns. The position in Diagram 75 is a draw, because it is
            impossible for the White King to get round his Kt pawn to drive
            off the Bishop.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag75.jpg" width="400" height="398" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 75</p>
          </div>
          <p>With two passed pawns distant from each other, a win can
            generally be forced, as in the following position (Diagram 76).</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p class="noindent">
            The King moves up to the pawn, the progress of which is barred by
            the Bishop (not the King). He thereby forces the sacrifice of the
            Bishop. If the Black King comes to the rescue of the Bishop, the
            other pawn proves Black&rsquo;s downfall.</p>
          <p>1. K-K4, K-K2; 2. K-Q5, K-Q2; 3. B-K4, B-K2; 4. P-Kt6, B-Q1; 5.

            B-B2, K-K1; 8. K-K6, B-Kt1; 9. B-Kt6ch, K-B1; 10. K-Q7, and wins.</p>
          <p>When the pawns are united, one should observe this rule: if they
            are attacked, they should, if possible, move to squares of the
            colour of the opposing Bishop.</p>
          <p>Therefore in the position set out in Diagram 77 White should not
            play P-B5, but P-K5. After 1. P-B5 there is no possible chance
            for White to assume the command of the Black squares, and in
            order to advance the pawns it is necessary</p>

          <p class="noindent">
            to force access to both White and Black squares. In the present
            instance play would proceed on these lines:</p>
          <p>1. P-K5, B-R4; 2. K-K3, K-B2; 3. K-K4, K-K2; 4. P-B5, B-Kt5; 5.
            P-B6ch, K-B1; 6. P-K6, B-R6; 7. B-R4, B-Kt5. White can only get
            through with the King&rsquo;s Pawn, as P-B7 is unavailing on the
            grounds set out above. But in order to play P-K7, the square K7
            must first be covered a second time, so that the Bishop cannot be
            given up for the two pawns. Therefore: 8. K-Q5, B-R6 (B-B6; P-
            K7ch); 9. K-B6, K-K1; 10. K-B7ch, K-B1; 11. K-Q7, and wins.</p>
          <p>In end-games with one Knight on each side, an extra pawn usually
            decides the game much in the same way as in end-games with
            Bishops of the same colour; frequently even with equal pawns, the
            possession of a passed pawn is sufficient, as it keeps either the
            King or the Knight busy, so that there is only one piece
            available for the defence of the pawns. An instructive example is
            the end-game Ed. Lasker-Rotlevi on p. 100.</p>
          <p>End-games with Rook against Rook are the most frequent, as well
            as the most difficult. Here the possession of an extra pawn is
            seldom sufficient for a win, unless the stronger side has also an
            advantage in the greater mobility of the Rook. Diagram 78 is
            typical of such cases, frequent in practice, in</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag78.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="[Illustration]" />

          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            which the greater mobility is the deciding factor. Although White
            has one pawn more, he can only win by reducing the mobility of
            the Black Rook through the following manœuvre: 1. R-B2, R-Q2;
            2. R-R2, R-R2. Now the Black Rook has only one move left, whilst
            the White Rook has the freedom of the Rook&rsquo;s file. For instance,
            the Rook can be posted at R5 and prevent the Black King from
            attacking White&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s side pawns, whilst the White King makes
            for the R at R7 and effects its capture. If, on the other hand,
            the Black King tries to obstruct the way to the Queen&rsquo;s side,
            White penetrates into the Black pawn position. Black cannot
            maintain the opposition because the White Rook has spare moves,
            the Black Rook none. e.g. 3. K-B3, K-Kt3; 4. R-R5, K-B3; 5. K-K4,
            K-K3; 6. R-R4, P-Kt3; 7. R-R5, K-Q3; 8. K-Q4, K-B3; 9. K-K5, and
            wins the pawns.</p>
          <p>Having the move, Black would draw the game by: 1. … R-Q7ch; 2.
            K-R3, R-R7. By placing his Rook behind the passed pawn he
            condemns the opposing Rook to inactivity, whilst his own is free
            to move on the Rook&rsquo;s file. If now the White King comes up, he
            will in the end force the sacrifice of the Black Rook for the
            pawn, but meanwhile the Black King captures the White pawns, and
            with passed pawns on the King&rsquo;s side might get winning chances.</p>
          <p>When there is only one pawn left in endings of R against R, the
            weaker side maintains the draw, if the King can command the
            queening square. Diagram 79 shows a position favourable to the
            stronger side, and which can mostly be obtained in this end-game.
            But here, too, Black forces a draw with a pretty manœuvre: 1.
            … R-B2; 2. R-KKt2, R-Q2ch; 3. PXR, and Black is stalemate.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag79.jpg" width="400" height="398" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 79</p>
          </div>
          <p>The chances of a draw are even greater in endings of Q against Q,
            as the King on the stronger side can seldom evade perpetual
            check. For the sake of completeness I will show a few cases in
            which Q or R cannot win against an advanced pawn.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 80 White can still draw, for in five moves the pawn
            reaches Kt7, supported by the King at R7, and in that time Black
            cannot come up with his King, so that he must give up the Rook
            for the pawn. Two passed pawns win, even when the King is away
            from them, if they have reached their sixth square. In Diagram
            81, for instance, White is lost,</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p class="noindent">
            as Black gives up his Rook at Q7 and plays P-Kt6, after which one
            of the pawns queens.</p>
          <p>The Queen wins against an advanced pawn, even when the latter is
            supported by the King; only the R or B pawn can</p>

            draw sometimes, when the pawn is on the seventh supported by the
            King, and the opposing Q cannot move to the queening square.</p>
          <p>The following illustrates the three principal cases:</p>
          <p> A. Position—White: K at QKt8, P at QR7<br />
            Black: K at QR8, Q at QB3
          </p>
          <p>Black must stop the pawn and plays Q-Kt3ch. White answers with K-
            R sq and is stalemate unless White lets the Kt&rsquo;s file free again.
            This end-game can only be won if the stronger King can assume the
            opposition in two moves. Therefore, if in the above example the
            Black King was standing at Q5, Black would win as follows: 1. …
            Q-K1ch; 2. K-Kt7, Q-K2ch; 3. K-Kt8, K-B4; 4. P-R8 = Q, K-Kt3. and
            White cannot cover the mate.
          </p>
          <p> B. Position—White: K at QKt8, P at QB7<br />
            Black: K at Q5, Q at QB3
          </p>
          <p>White draws: 1. … Q-Kt3ch; 2. K-R8, QxP stalemate.</p>
          <p> C. Position—White: K at QKt8, P at QKt7<br />

          <p>In the following pages I give some instructive examples taken
            from tournament play. Step by step we will find how very
            important is the knowledge of the simple endings treated in the
            last chapter. We shall see that it is often necessary to consider
            many moves ahead to find the correct line, but that it is nearly
            always possible to foresee every consequence with unfailing
            certainty. Moreover, because of the reduction of forces there is
            no call to take very many variations into consideration. This
            explains why there is a tendency in modern master play to enforce
            the exchange of pieces, as soon as there is the slightest
            advantage sufficient to bring about one of the elementary end-
            game positions, in which the win can be forced.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Black has an extra pawn on the Queen&rsquo;s side. But as it is
            doubled, the material superiority is of no account. A perceptible
            advantage, however, lies in the fact that White cannot bring
            about a &ldquo;forced move&rdquo; position, as Black has the move P-QB4 in
            reserve. White has also an infinitesimal weakness on the King&rsquo;s
            side, the Rook&rsquo;s pawn having advanced two squares and being
            therefore an easy mark. This disadvantage soon becomes apparent.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 1. P-B3 K-B4
            2. K-B2 P-R4
            3. K-Kt2 P-Kt4
            4. K-R3 K-K4</p>
          <p>With this move advantage is taken of one of White&rsquo;s weaknesses.
            White must exchange pawns. If the King moves, Black captures,
            freeing B 5 for his King, from where he can later on get to K6 or
            Kt6. But after the exchange at Kt4, Black has the chance of
            obtaining a &ldquo;distant passed pawn&rdquo; on the Rook&rsquo;s file.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 5. PxP PxP
            6. K-Kt2 K-B4
            7. K-R2 K-B3</p>
          <p>If Black were to play P-R5 at once, White would reply with 8. K-
            R3, and after PxP, 9. KxP. Black would have to give up the spare
            move P-B4, to gain the square at B5 for his King. The game then
            would be drawn after 10. K-Kt2! K-B5, 11. K-B2, because White
            maintains the opposition, and Black cannot get through at K6 or
            Kt6. Black therefore manœuvres his King first in such a way that
            the square at his B4 is only reached when the White King is at
            Kt3.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 8. K-Kt2 K-Kt3
            9. K-R2 P-R5</p>
          <p>Now neither PxP nor P-B4 is of any use. In the first case Black
            obtains the distant passed pawn. In the second White obtains the
            distant passed pawn after 10. P-B4, PxBP; 11. PxRP, but loses it
            again after K-R4; 12. K-R3, P-B4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 10. K-R3 PxP
            11. KxP K-B4</p>
          <p>At last Black has captured the coveted square, whilst keeping the
            spare move in hand.</p>
          <h5> 12. K-B2 K-B5</h5>
          <p>The White King cannot move to Kt2 now, because in that case Black
            would move the King to the White QBP and queen in seven moves,
            and White, after seven moves, would only have the KB pawn at B7.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 13. K-K2 K-Kt6
            14. K-K3 P-B4</p>
          <p>and wins, for White cannot hold the KBP now, but must capture the
            KtP in exchange for it, after which the Black King reaches the
            Queen&rsquo;s side two moves ahead, e.g.:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 15. K-K2 K-Kt7
            16. K-K3 K-B8!
            17. K-K4 K-B7
            18. K-B5 KxP
            19. KxP K-K6, etc.</p>
          <p>Black would have forced a win also if White had played K-Kt2 on
            his twelfth move thus: 12. K-Kt2, K-B5; 13. K-B2.</p>
          <p>Now White has the opposition, and after Black wrings it from him
            by playing the spare move P-B4, he assumes it again with 14. K-
            K2, K-Kt6; 15. K-K3. But he cannot maintain it after Black&rsquo;s K-R6
            because the square at Q3 for distant opposition is not
            accessible. After 16. K-Q2, K-R7!; 17. K-K3, K-Kt6; 18. K-K2, K-
            Kt7; 19. K-K3, K-B8 we get the same result as before.</p>
          <h4>II. FROM A GAME ED. LASKER-ROTLEVI (HAMBURG, 1910).</h4>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

            <p class="caption">Diag. 83</p>
          </div>
          <p>White has the advantage, because Black must keep either his King
            or his Knight permanently near the passed pawn, guarding against
            its advance, whilst both White&rsquo;s King and Knight can attack the
            Black pawns. As yet they stand so far in the rear that the White
            King cannot approach them Therefore White must first try to force
            their advance.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 1. Kt-B5 P-Kt3
            2. Kt-Q3 P-R4</p>
          <p>This is now necessary, because the square B3 is weak after P-Kt3
            and the White Knight threatens to win the Rook&rsquo;s pawn eventually
            with a check at B6. For this reason Kt-Q 2, for instance, could
            not be played instead of the move in the text, because 3. Kt-K5
            would follow. Black now cannot exchange, of course, otherwise the
            position would resolve itself to an easy end game win similar to
            the one in Diagram 56. There would be nothing left but Kt-Kt1 to
            oppose the threat of Kt-B6ch, and this would get the Knight
            entirely out of play, so that White could queen the passed pawn
            easily after 4. K-Kt6.</p>
          <h5> 3. K-K5 P-B3</h5>
          <p>The King was threatening to enter via Q5 and B6.</p>
          <p> 4. K-B5 Kt-K3</p>
          <p>If Black wishes to obviate the threat: Kt-K5-B4, and plays P-Kt4,
            the White King goes to QB5 and wins all the pawns easily.
            Therefore Black endeavours to sacrifice a pawn in order to
            exchange the two others, after which a draw could be forced by
            exchanging the Knight for the remaining White pawn.</p>

          <p> 10. Kt-R7</p>
          <p>Here White had only considered the following answer:</p>
          <p>Kt-Q6ch; 11. K-Q4, KtxKtP; 12. KtxP, Kt-Q6; 13. P-B5, Kt-Kt5; 14.

            and wins the Knight.
          </p>
          <p>Black however draws, through a pretty combination:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 10. … P-Kt5
            11. K-Q4 P-B6

            13. KxP KtxP</p>
          <p>and White cannot prevent the ultimate exchange of Kt for P. The
            last winning chance would have been: 10. K-Q4!, Kt-Q; 11. K-B3.
            This is in any case the more plausible line, because now White
            can attack the pawns with both King and Knight, as both the Black
            pieces are away from the field of operations. The sequel could
            be: 11. KtxBP; 12. P-R3 (Kt-R7 would only draw: Kt-K7ch; 13. K-
            Kt4, Kt-B8 14. P-R3, Kt-R7ch; 15. KxP, P-B6); 12. Kt-Q4ch 13. K-

          <p>White has just played Q-B4. P-B5 is threatened, and Black is
            forced to exchange Queens. The ensuing end-game, however, is
            inferior for Black, because the QP is weak and White threatens
            eventually to force his Queen&rsquo;s Pawn through.</p>

          <p>If Black wants to avoid the exchange, he must yield up the King&rsquo;s
            file to White, and that would surely spell disaster, as the Black
            Rook would have no field of action, and would have to go to Q1 to
            avoid the loss of a pawn through Kt-Kt5ch, after which the White
            Rook would take possession of the seventh rank, fettering the
            action of the Bishop into the bargain.</p>

          <p>In order to play P-QKt4 and P-B5, then to force Black to exchange
            at B5, White must first have the opportunity of bearing a second
            time on Black&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Pawn. Therefore he prepares the

          <p>It is not yet easy to materialise the advantage in position The
            advance P-Q6ch would be very bad, as B6 and K6 would be made
            accessible for Black. White starts by tempting the pawns forward
            and thus systematically creates points of attack.</p>

          <p>The Queen&rsquo;s side is paralysed. The text move is forced, as P-R6
            would give White yet another passed pawn. Now White turns his
            attention to the King&rsquo;s side.</p>

            29. … P-KKt4 is parried by PxP e.p. The difference in the pawn
            positions, which decides the issue for White, is found in the
            fact that the White passed pawn at Q5 is unassailable because the
            support of the BP cannot be taken away by Black&rsquo;s P-Kt3, whilst
            Black&rsquo;s passed pawn at his B3 can be isolated at any time through
            P-R4-R5. White would take up a position on the Knight&rsquo;s file with
            the King, and push on the Rook&rsquo;s pawn. The isolated pawns are
            then an easy prey. On the text move White also pushes the Rook&rsquo;s
            pawn on to compel P-R3 and reduce Black to moves by the King. The

            obtain on the QKt file would decide the issue. But, supported by
            the mobile Rook, the centre pawns become irresistible. Instead of
            the text move, P-KB4 was necessary in order to release the Rook.</p>

          <p>If it were not for the Rooks, the centre pawns would not help
            White, because Black would obtain a passed pawn on either wing.

          <p>For after RxR, 17. PxR, White captures the BP, and still
            overtakes the passed pawn which Black obtains on the Queen&rsquo;s
            wing; the pawns at Q5 and B6 are unassailable (K-K8, P-Q6, K-B7,
            P-Q7, etc.). The consequences of 16. R-B6 had to be calculated to
            a nicety. If, for instance, the QKtP were already at his fourth,
            White would lose. In four moves Black would have one of his pawns
            at his R6, the other at Kt5. In the meantime White would have
            taken the BP and come back to the Q file. Now Black would win
            with P-Kt6, because after PxP the RP queens unmolested.</p>

          <p>White&rsquo;s position is superior; firstly, because the only open file
            on the board is his, and secondly, because the Black Queen&rsquo;s side
            pawns are advanced, and therefore weak for a King&rsquo;s ending. After
            exchanging the Queen and one Rook, the possession of the King&rsquo;s
            file ensures the advance of the King to K4 and from there to Q5.

          <p>PxP is no threat, because White wins the pawn back at once with

          <p>Black probably hopes for a counter chance by getting a distant

            of the Queen&rsquo;s side pawns, and even without the exchange of
            Rooks, White would win, by settling the King&rsquo;s side first and
            then tearing up the Queen&rsquo;s side, as in the game: 10. P-KKt4, R-

          <p>After l3. … PxP, however, there follows 14. KxP. Then White

            THE MIDDLE GAME</h2>
          <h3>GENERAL REMARKS</h3>
          <p style="margin-top: 3em">HAVING now a fair knowledge of the end-game, we should be in a
            position to appreciate how the middle game should be conducted.
            We must throughout maintain a favourable pawn formation, in view
            of the end-game which might be forced on us by exchanges. On the
            other hand, as soon as we have gained an advantage sufficient to
            secure the victory in the end-game, we must ourselves, by the
            exchange of pieces, try to reduce the position to one of the
            typical elementary cases which we have discussed. Now it will
            invariably be found that beginners are unwilling to make these
            essential exchanges. This is explained by the attraction which
            combinations involving the action of many pieces have for them.
            They assume that exchanges, particularly of the Queens, make the
            games dull. Such ideas only prove that the beginner has not
            grasped the nature of chess, the essence of which is stern logic
            and uncompromising conclusions, and this demands the shortest and
            clearest way leading to a mate. To the strong player, able to
            play logically, logic will always be inseparable from beauty in
            chess.</p>
          <p>To play logically means to subordinate all combinations to a
            leading plan of campaign, but there is difficulty in finding the
            latter. An unsound scheme, even if worked out to its logical
            conclusion, can of course be of no value. All the same it is
            better than no plan at all. And in time one gains by experience,
            and develops a sort of instinct for rejecting from the large
            number of possible operations all those which, properly
            countered, cannot bring any advantage.</p>
          <p>Beside practical play, which is essential in order to gain this
            instinct, a methodical theoretical instruction is of inestimable
            value, and accelerates the development of the student&rsquo;s mind. Now
            the instruction I wish to give in the THEORY of chess will not
            take the form of an ANALYSIS, brought up right into the middle
            game, of the various openings, tested and found correct in master
            play. Such collections erroneously bear the title of &ldquo;Theory of
            the Openings,&rdquo; and are, besides, quite useless at this stage,
            since they only embody the results of ANALYSIS.</p>
          <p>It is first necessary to ascertain a few leading principles,
            which can be taught in a most simple manner, by the exercise of
            common sense, rather than by applying oneself to the study of
            long-winded analysis. The student will no longer need to discover
            time-worn maxims in the light of his own weary experience, and on
            the other hand, these principles will help him to understand
            analysis, and to keep clearly before his mind&rsquo;s eye the common
            and principal lines of play, of which he might easily lose sight
            in the labyrinth of suggested variations.</p>
          <p>I propose to show the application of such principles to master
            play, and this will give us a further opportunity of deeper
            study, both of the rules set out in the first part for conducting
            the opening correctly, and of the end-game principles, which
            should be well considered.</p>
          <p>I have made the pawn skeleton with its attendant grouping of
            pieces the main consideration in the study of the opening; now in
            the investigation of the problems of the middle game, I will
            start from the TRANSFORMATION which the pawn skeleton has to
            undergo in the course of further operations. In my opinion this
            is the best starting-point for the choice of effective manœuvres
            of the different pieces.</p>
          <p>Before we are able to evolve a practical scheme we must have
            under consideration the following important points: How do we
            know if an attack is likely to succeed? In other words: On what
            point should I concentrate the attack? It should be clear to all
            that it is of no possible use to direct an attack on anything
            that can move away. Yet beginners frequently infringe this
            obvious rule, and I have often witnessed manœuvres such as these
            (Diagram 90):</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag90.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 90</p>
          </div>
          <p>1. P-QR3, 2. P-QKt4, and then, after the B has retired to his Kt3
            even, 3. R-QKt1, 4. P-QR4, 5. P-R5. Meanwhile Black will have
            played P-QR3, to make a loophole for his B at R2, and what is the
            result? The Black Bishop is as effectual at R2 as at B4, but
            White has advanced his pawns, and weakened them, as they are now
            more liable to attack. Moreover, White has used up five moves to
            achieve his aim, whilst Black only needed three. Therefore Black
            has gained two moves, which he can use for the development of his
            pieces.</p>
          <p>Diagram 91 illustrates another mistake frequently made in the
            choice of an objective, and one which can utterly spoil the whole
            game, even in its earliest stage. Black has to</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag91.jpg" width="400" height="395" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 91</p>
          </div>
          <p class="noindent">
            move, and his game is somewhat hindered by the dominating
            position of the White Queen. The latter prevents the Bishop from
            occupying a desirable square at his QB4, and also makes the
            liberating move P-Q4 impossible. Therefore it would seem
            desirable to drive the Queen away. But this should only be done
            if it is not attended by some further disadvantage.</p>
          <p>Now the average player is not particularly fastidious in his
            methods. The Queen irritates him, therefore the Queen must be
            repelled one way or the other. He would probably try P-QB4. The
            result is that the Queen selects another good square, for
            instance at K3 or QR4, but Black has not improved matters, for he
            still can play neither B-B4 nor P-Q4. On the other hand,
            irredeemable harm has been done, inasmuch as the Black QP now
            remains &ldquo;backward.&rdquo; The attack on the Queen by P-QB4 must
            consequently be rejected. Sallies such as these, in which short-
            lived attacks are made by pawns upon pieces, are always of
            doubtful value. They must unquestionably be avoided if they break
            up the pawn skeleton, which is formed in the opening, and confine
            the mobility of the pieces.</p>
          <p>Also with regard to manœuvres of PIECES, intended solely to
            drive away an opposing piece, it is obviously essential that the
            attacking pieces in effecting their purpose should not be made to
            stray too far afield, lest they become out of play.</p>
          <p>I shall delay dealing with the features underlying good forms of
            attack, both by pieces and pawns, until I have treated of the
            choice of an objective.</p>
          <p>From what we have already expounded, it is clear that the subject
            of an attack should be incapable of evasion. Should it, in the
            course of attack, be desired to prevent a PIECE from being moved,
            that can only be effected by means of a &ldquo;pin.&rdquo; A PAWN, however,
            can be held in place either by occupying the square immediately
            in front of it, or by controlling the latter with more forces
            than the opponent can bring to bear upon it.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag92.jpg" width="400" height="398" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 92</p>
          </div>
          <p>The last two diagrams exemplify this. If in Diagram 91 Black
            makes the mistake of playing P-QB4 as suggested, the backward QP
            becomes a welcome objective for White&rsquo;s attack. White can keep
            that pawn back by playing P-Q B4 as soon as it threatens to
            advance, after which he would develop quietly, double his Rooks,
            and bring the Q and QB to bear in a concentrated attack on Q6. A
            position not unlike that in Diagram 92 will result ultimately, in
            which Black defends the pawn as many times as it is attacked, but
            in which White can bring up his KP to the attack, as the QP
            cannot move away, whilst Black has no further defensive move at
            his disposal. Play against a backward pawn nearly always
            develops on these lines, and is even easier when there is no
            defending B of the same colour as the pawn. (See p. 40, and Game
            No. 26.)</p>
          <p>Such manœuvres, in the course of which pieces are pinned and
            attacked, are illustrated in Diagram 90. The most obvious move,
            which initiates an attack and at the same time completes the
            development of the minor pieces, is B-Kt5. Attacks by means of
            such devices are so frequent and varied that it will be necessary
            to treat them at some length, which I now propose to do. I should
            also add that, with regard to Diagram 90, the student will derive
            lasting benefit from a thorough study of the position, and will
            thus improve his power to judge of the desirability, or
            otherwise, of obtaining open files, diagonals, doubled pawns,
            etc. After B-KKt5, the threat is to attack the Knight a second
            and third time with Kt-Q5, and Q-B3, after moving the KKt away.
            As Black&rsquo;s KKt is only supported twice, and there is no chance of
            bringing up more forces for its defence, Black must undertake
            something to provide against the threatened onslaught.</p>
          <p>The most natural plan is to develop the QB at K3, from where it
            can be exchanged for the Knight should Kt-Q5 be played. The
            doubled pawn, which White could force by exchanging the Bishops,
            is in no way detrimental to Black&rsquo;s game. On the contrary, the
            opening of the file for the Rook, with the attendant chance of
            playing P-Q4 supported by the doubled pawn, gives Black the
            advantage.</p>
          <p>The doubled pawn which Black obtains after 2. Kt-Q5, BxKt; 3. PxB
            (or 3. BxB), Kt-K2; 4. BxKt, would also be of no help to White.
            The apparent weakness created in Black&rsquo;s game at KB3 and KR3 by
            the disappearance of the KtP does not assist White in this case,
            because the pieces which could take advantage of such a weakness,
            the QB and the Kt at Q5, have been exchanged. There only remains
            the KKt and the Q for an immediate attack, whilst the Black Rook
            will soon get into effective action on the open Knight&rsquo;s file,
            e.g. 5. Q-Q2, K-R1; 6. Q-R6, Kt-Kt3; 7. Kt-R4, KtxKt; 8. QxKt, Q-
            K2, followed by the doubling of the Rooks on the Kt file.
            Considerations of a similar nature would tend to show that 1. B-
            Kt5, Kt-K2; 2. BxKt, PxB is in favour of Black. The White QB,
            which is so effective in taking advantage of weaknesses at
            Black&rsquo;s KB3 and R3, has been exchanged. The Queen&rsquo;s Knight is not
            available for attack on the KBP, as it would be exchanged or else
            driven off in time by P-B3. Compared with the position considered
            above, which occurs after 1. … B-K3, 2. Kt-Q5, Black has the
            further advantage of maintaining his QB, which makes it possible
            to push the weak KBP on to his fourth, and either exchange it or
            push it still further to B5, a useful and secure position.</p>
          <p>Matters would be different were Black to allow his King&rsquo;s wing to
            be broken up without getting rid of White&rsquo;s dangerous pieces by
            exchanges. Let us consider what happens, if Black takes no
            measures against Kt-Q5, but only prevents White&rsquo;s ultimate Q-B3
            by pinning the Knight with B-KKt5. White gains a decisive
            advantage by bringing his Queen into play before Black is able to
            secure himself against the threatened combined attack of Q and B,
            or alternately Q and Kt by K-R1, R-Kt1-Kt3. I will give two
            examples of how the whole game now centres on the attack and
            defence of the points weakened by the disappearance of the KtP,
            and how White pushes home his advantage in the one instance with
            the help of the B, in the other by the co-operation of the Kt.</p>
          <p>
            I. 1. B-KKt5, B-KKt5; 2. Kt-Q5, Kt-Q5; 3. Q-Q2, BxKt?; 4.
            BxKt, PxB; 5. Q-R6, and there is no reply to the threat of KtxPch
            and QxP mate, except through the sacrifice of the Q. Forcing the
            exchange of Knights is of no avail, for after 5. … Kt-K7ch; 6.
            K-R1, BxPch; 7. KxB, Kt-B5ch; 8. KtxKt, PxKt; 9. K-R1, White
            occupies the Kt file first and wins easily: 9. … K-R1; 10. R-
            KKt1, R-KKt1; 11. RxR, QxR; 12. R-KKt1 followed by mate or loss
            of the Queen.</p>
          <p>
            II. 3. Q-Q2, P-B3; 4. KtxKtch, PxKt; 5. B-R4! BxKt; 6. Q-
            R6, Kt-K7ch; 7. K-R1, BxPch; 8. KxB, Kt-B5ch; 9. K-R1, Kt-Kt3.
            Now Black has succeeded in interrupting the White Queen&rsquo;s action
            on the BP. But it has taken many moves, with the sole result that
            Black&rsquo;s Queen&rsquo;s Knight is better placed. All the other pieces,
            however, occupy the positions they took up in the opening. The
            Black Knight, moreover, is only supported by the RP until Black
            manages to block the White Bishop&rsquo;s diagonal by P-Q4. Meanwhile
            White has gained a big start, and is ready to occupy the open
            file with his Rooks. The sequel might be: 10. P-Q4!, BxP (if PxP;

          <p>Taking it all in all, we see from the foregoing that the pinning
            of the Black Knight can only be injurious to Black if he does not
            take timely measures to provide against White&rsquo;s Kt-Q5, which
            threatens to concentrate more forces for the attack on KB6 than
            Black is able to mobilise for its defence.</p>
          <p>Beginners, after having experienced frequent trouble through
            their inadequate defence of this kind of attack, try to avoid
            their recurrence by making such pinning moves impossible from the
            first and playing P-R3 on whichever side the pin is threatened.
            Apart from the loss of time, on which I remarked at length when
            discussing the opening, such pawn moves have various other
            drawbacks.</p>
          <p>With every pawn move it should be considered whether the squares
            protected by the pawn before it has moved may not need the
            support of that pawn at a later stage. This is particularly the
            case with regard to squares in front of the castled King. If one
            of those pawns pushes on, the squares which have lost its
            protection frequently offer an opening for a direct attack by the
            enemy&rsquo;s pieces on the King.</p>
          <p>A second consideration is the fact that the advancing pawn itself
            becomes a target for an assault in which the opponent, moving up
            a pawn on the next file, brings his Rooks into play, or in which
            he sacrifices a piece for the advanced pawn and the one that
            protects it, thus robbing the King of the protection he sought to
            obtain in castling.</p>
          <p>The following examples will contribute much to the understanding
            of this most important subject, the grasp of which will mean a
            great step forward for the student.</p>
          <p>The position in Diagram 93 is from a game v. Scheve-Teichmann
            (Berlin, 1907). White played 1. P-R3 in order to avoid the
            pinning of his Knight through B-Kt5. The move is not unjustified,
            as the Knight is required for the support of the square at Q4.
            The pawn move, however, has the drawbacks enumerated above, and
            White must think of keeping a sufficiency of pieces for the fight
            on the King&rsquo;s wing, in order to prevent Black from utilising the
            weakness thus created for a combined assault by superior forces.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p>In this case White does not take precautionary measures, and
            succumbs in a surprisingly short time.</p>
          <p>1. … Kt-B3; 2. PxP? With this move White opens the diagonal for
            Black&rsquo;s KB for no apparent reason. 2. … QKtxP; 3. KtxKt?
            Instead of providing for the defence of his King&rsquo;s wing, White
            exchanges one of the King&rsquo;s side pieces, 3. … QxKt; 4. Kt-Q2,
            BxP! White has provoked this sacrifice by his last two moves. The
            KBP is pinned, and the Q enters by way of her Kt6, the protection
            of which was given up by pushing on the RP. The rest is easy; 5.

          <p>Diagram 94 shows a position from a game Marshall-Burn (Ostend,
            1907). Strong in the knowledge that the Black Queen&rsquo;s side pieces
            are not developed, and can only with difficulty be of assistance
            in the defence of the King&rsquo;s side because of their limited
            mobility, White takes advantage of the weakness created by the
            advance of the Black KKt pawn to his third, and initiates an
            immediate assault on the King&rsquo;s stronghold.</p>

          <p>1. P-KR4, R-K1; 2. P-R5. This forces open the Rook&rsquo;s file. If the
            pawn were still at Kt2, Black would simply let White push on to
            R6 and then reply with P-KKt3. 2. … KtxP; 3. RxKt, White
            concludes the game in brilliant style. Black&rsquo;s wrong development
            has given a welcome opportunity for sacrificial combinations. Now
            the KB has an open diagonal, the pawn position is broken, and
            White&rsquo;s Q and R have no difficulty in using the Rook&rsquo;s file for a
            deadly attack. 3. … PxR; 4. BxPch, KxB; 5. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Kt3 (if
            K-Kt1, then 6. QxP, Kt-B3; 7. QxPch, K-R1; 8. Castles, etc.); 6.

            QxPch, K-K5; 14. Castles, followed by P-B3 or R-Q4 mate.</p>
          <p>In cases where both sides have already castled on the same wing,
            and the opponent has weakened his position by pushing on one of
            the pawns of that wing, it is seldom advisable to start an attack
            with the advance of one of the pawns in front of the King, as the
            latter&rsquo;s position would be weakened. An attack of this kind is
            only justified if there is a prospect of concentrating with all
            speed a superior force before the opponent has time for a counter
            attack.</p>
          <p>The Black position in Diagram 95 illustrates one much favoured by
            &ldquo;natural&rdquo; players. Here the advance of the</p>

            KRP would not be a suitable plan of attack for White as his Rook
            is no longer on the Rook&rsquo;s file, nor could it be brought back in
            time. In this case White must endeavour to take advantage of the
            weaknesses at Black&rsquo;s KB3 and KR3, produced by his move P-KKt3.
            This will be the modus operandi: Q-Q2 followed by B-R6, forcing
            the exchange of Black&rsquo;s valuable KB. After that the Q in
            conjunction with one of the Knights will attempt to force an
            entry at KB6 or KR6, as for instance in the following, the moves

          <p>A somewhat more difficult case is shown in Diagram 96.</p>

            Here the advance of the White King&rsquo;s side pawns has undeniably
            produced weaknesses in the pawn skeleton, and these would be
            fatal had the Black pieces as much mobility as the White ones.
            But the congestion of Black&rsquo;s pieces on the Queen&rsquo;s side makes
            his defence unwieldy, and White has no difficulty in accumulating
            his forces on the King&rsquo;s side for the final assault. The
            prospects are that White will be able to bring home his attack,
            before Black has a chance of forcing exchanges and of bringing
            about the end-game, which through the weakness of the White pawns
            would probably turn to his advantage. The play (E. Cohn-Ed.
            Lasker match, Berlin, 1909) is instructive, and shows how the
            attack should be conducted in such positions. 1. Kt-Kt3, B-Kt2;
            2. K-R2, P-B3; 3. R-KKt1, Kt-Q2; 4. Kt-R4, K-B2. The
            concentration of the White pieces has become alarming, and
            threatens to be continued by Q-Q2, R-Kt2. QR-KKt1, and Kt-B5. So
            the Black King decides on flight, but he finds no peace on the Q
            side either, because there his advanced pawns soon allow White to
            make a breach in the Black position.</p>
          <p>5. Kt-Kt2, K-K2; 6. Q-K2, Kt-Kt3; 7. KR-KB1, B-B1. It is Black&rsquo;s
            intention to play P-B4 as soon as practicable, and to make an
            attempt at a counter demonstration on the King&rsquo;s side, 8. P-K B4,
            K-Q1? (Black should have kept to his original intention and
            played P-B4); 9. PxP, QPxP; 10. Q-B2, Kt-Q2; 11. P-QR4; B-Kt2;
            12. PxP, PxP; 13. RxR, BxR. Now White has achieved what he set
            out to do. He has opened up avenues of attack on the Queen&rsquo;s
            side, and is ready to utilise the weakness of Black&rsquo;s QBP by
            playing P-Kt4, on which Black must submit to opening the file for
            the White KR or the diagonal for the White QB. In either case
            White brings vastly superior forces to bear on the Black King&rsquo;s
            position, and Black should lose. In this game Black escaped only
            through a mistake on the part of his opponent.</p>
          <p>In the foregoing positions it was seen how fatal weaknesses can
            be, which are produced by the premature advance of the pawns in
            front of the King, on whom the opposing pieces can force their
            attack. When the pawns concerned are on the opposite wing to
            their King, the disadvantages of a premature advance are felt in
            a different way. The weakness concerns the pawns themselves and
            not the forces behind them, and is apt to cause the loss of the
            end-game, particularly of Rook end-games. Let us compare the
            positions in Diagrams 97</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag97.jpg" width="400" height="397" alt="[Illustration]" />

            and 98. In the one case the chain of Black pawns is broken by the
            absence of K Kt P, in the other of the Q Kt P. The absence of the
            KKt pawn can lead to serious consequences in the middle game,
            because of the weakness of Black&rsquo;s KB3 and KR3 (compare Diagram
            90); it can, however, hardly become awkward in the end-game, as
            the pawns on the B and R files are within the protecting reach of
            their King.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
            <img src="images/diag98.jpg" width="400" height="398" alt="[Illustration]" />
            <p class="caption">Diag. 98</p>
          </div>
          <p>On the other hand, the absence of the Q Kt P is of no consequence
            for the middle game. There is nothing behind it which could
            invite an attack. The QRP and QBP, however, are very weak for the
            end-game, as they are quite out of reach of the King (compare
            Game No. 19). I do not wish to imply that Black should have
            avoided the exchange at his QB3 at all cost; such an exchange has
            always the compensating advantage of opening a file for the
            Rooks, which advantage often means a favourable middle game, as
            will be readily understood. Further, it is often possible to get
            rid of the weak QRP by pushing it on, and eventually compelling
            the exchange of the opposing Kt P, an exchange which can usually
            be enforced if the Rooks have occupied the open Kt file. The pawn
            itself is often useful at B 3, in that it can support the advance
            of P-Q 4 in the centre, should it be desired, or it can, by
            pushing on, be brought to exercise further pressure on the
            opposing Kt P.</p>
          <p>The break-up of the pawn position on the Q side can become
            awkward in the end-game and sometimes in the middle-game when the
            pawns can be attacked, and pieces brought to bear on the Queen&rsquo;s
            side without leaving the King&rsquo;s side denuded of forces.</p>
          <p>This will be illustrated by the position in Diagram 99.</p>

          <h5>FROM A GAME FR. LAZARD-ED. LASKER (PARIS, 1914)</h5>
          <p>Here the pawn positions on both sides are broken, and the player
            that occupies the open files first, gets a decisive advantage.
            In this case it is Black&rsquo;s move. We can conclude at once that
            White has played the opening badly. He must have lost two moves,
            for he has still to capture the BP and then, being White, it
            should be his move. This disadvantage, small as it may seem, with
            which White has emerged from the opening, is sufficient to bring
            him into the greatest difficulties. Black, of course, does not
            defend the pawn by B-Kt2 or B-Q2, as this would practically
            reduce the B to a P and, moreover, White, by R-Kt1 or Q1, would
            both attack the B and obtain an open file. Instead of that, Black
            utilises the two moves, which he has, as it were, as a gift in an
            otherwise equalised position, to bring both Rooks on the Kt file.
            This policy allows Black to occupy the seventh or eighth rank at
            will, and to attack the White pawns from the flank or rear,
            according to circumstances. This menace hampers the radius of
            action of the White pieces, as they must always be ready for the
            defence of the threatened pawns, and this gives Black by far the
            superior game.</p>
          <p>The play was continued as follows: 1. … R-Kt1; 2. BxP, R-Kt7;
            3. B-K4, B-K3; 4. P-QR3, KR-Kt1. The Knight&rsquo;s file is now
            definitely in Black&rsquo;s hands. White could occupy the Queen&rsquo;s file,
            but the Black B at K3, which prevents the entry of the Rooks at
            Q7, makes the operation aimless. Therefore White is condemned to
            inactivity. On the contrary, Black&rsquo;s line of action is clear. His
            entry on the seventh can only achieve something if White&rsquo;s QBP
            can be deprived of its support. To do this Black has only to play
            P-QB4-B5 and P-KB4. This, of course, weakens Black&rsquo;s KB, and the
            White Rooks might obtain an entry on the K file. Therefore Black
            will effect a timely exchange of one of his Rooks, after which
            his King alone will hold the K file. These considerations make
            the following moves clear: 5. KR-K1, P-QB4; 6. P-KR3, a further
            awkward necessity in positions of this kind. Before the Rook can
            venture out, a loophole must be provided for the King.</p>
          <p>6. … P-B5; 7. R-K3, R-Kt8ch; 8. RxR, RxRch; 9. K-R2, P-B4; 10.
            B-B3, K-B2; 11. B-K2 (threatening R-QB3), R-Kt2; 12. R-QB3, K-B3
            (now BxP is not feasible on account of R-QB2); 13. P-B4. White
            wishes to keep the Black King from his Q5 but cannot do so
            permanently. Black, however, can occupy the Q file with his Rook,
            and confine the White King to his wing. 13. … R-Q2; 14. K-Kt3)
            R-Q5; 15. K-B3, K-K2; 16. R-K3, K-Q3; 17. K-Kt3, R-Q7; 18. P-B3,
            B-B2. R-R7 would be a mistake on account of RxBch, but the QRP
            cannot escape. 19. P-QR4, P-Kt3; 20. B-B3, R-R7; 21. B-Q1, B-Q4;
            22. R-K2, R-R8; 23. R-Q2, R-R6; 24. R-QB2, RxRP. Now at last
            Black has obtained material gain, which was made possible by his
            command of the open Kt file. To convert it into a win by queening
            the extra pawn is only a matter of time.</p>
          <p>We have now seen how the possession of open files reacts on the
            mobility of the opposing forces, forever increasing their
            difficulties until the positional advantage is converted into
            material gain. We shall meet with cases later on in which the
            greater mobility of minor pieces achieves the same result and
            find more and more proofs of the truth of the main general
            principles which I introduced at the outset.</p>
          <p>Let us now recapitulate the chief points touched upon in the
            course of our deliberations:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 6%; margin-right: 6%">
            1. Generally speaking, attacks should only be directed to
            objects which cannot be moved away.</p>
          <p>2. If in particular cases the attack is aimed at driving off
            an opposing piece from an especially favourable post that attack
            is unwise, if it involves the weakening the pawn position, or if
            pieces have to take up inferior positions in order to effect
            their purpose.</p>
          <p>3. Pawn moves always create weaknesses, either by leaving
            other unsupported pawns behind, or by giving opposing pieces
            access to squares formerly guarded by them, and this more
            specially so in front of the castled King.</p>
          <p>4. Attacks which depend on pawn moves are only justified if
            overwhelming forces can be accumulated in support, as the
            advanced pawns might become the object of a counter attack.</p>
          <p>5. As pawn moves have very generally some drawbacks, the
            middle game is the pieces&rsquo; own hunting ground. As in the
            opening, the first consideration of sound play in the middle game
            is to make only such moves as do not reduce the mobility of the
            pieces.</p>
          <p>As illustrative of such manœuvres I shall now give examples from
            actual master play. In my annotations of these games I have tried
            to keep before the student&rsquo;s mind constantly the main ideas
            underlying the different combinations which spring from general
            strategical principles. I thus avoid burdening his memory with a
            mass of detail, and bring into prominence the basic principle of
            each line of play, thereby developing his capacity for conducting
            a middle game, even after an unusual opening.</p>
          <p>I have fixed mainly upon such games as are illustrative of the
            openings treated in the first part of this book. In most cases
            the first moves will, therefore, not need any special remarks.
            The end-games, being typical examples, will only need reference
            to the chapters in which they have been respectively dealt with.</p>

          <p> White: Tartakower. Black: Burn.</p>
          <p> King&rsquo;s Gambit declined (compare p. 30).</p>

            3. Kt-KB3 P-Q3
            4. PxP</p>
          <p>On principle this exchange cannot be commended, as the opening of
            the Queen&rsquo;s file increases the Black Queen&rsquo;s mobility. White
            derives no benefit from the KB file so long as the Black Bishop
            makes castling impossible. White intends to play P-B3 and P-Q4,
            but the manœuvre is doubtful, and the whole opening includes an
            inordinately large number of pawn moves. In the present game
            Black exposes the failings inherent to this system unequivocally.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 4. … PxP
            5. P-B3 Kt-QB3</p>
          <p>Black cannot put off White&rsquo;s P-Q4 by B-KKt5, for White can give a
            check with the Queen and unpin the Knight.</p>
          <p> 6. P-QKt4</p>
          <p>The object of this move is not clear, as P-Kt5 does not win a
            pawn (Kt-R4; 8. KtxP; 9. Q-R5ch). It does not promote development
            either, and only compromises the QBP and QKtP.</p>

            7. B-Kt5 Kt-B3</p>
          <p>This is aimed at the White King&rsquo;s pawn, which is deprived of its
            natural support by the QKt. In this position Black does well to
            attack White&rsquo;s KP rather than to defend his own, because an open
            King&rsquo;s file can only benefit him. Being able to castle, he can
            occupy the file with his Rook before White has time to bring his
            King into safety.</p>
          <p> 8. KtxP</p>
          <p>It would have been better to protect the pawn by Q-K2 or P-Q3.</p>

            Bishop or the Knight, he is overwhelmed.

          <p> 9. KtxKt</p>
          <p>After 9. BxKt, PxB; 10. KtxP, Q-K1 wins; 10. P-Q4 would also lose
            because Black gains two pawns after KtxP; 11. O-O, KtxP. It is
            interesting to note how speedily the weakness at White&rsquo;s QB3 is
            brought to book.</p>

          <p>Now White can neither take the Kt nor the R. In the first case Q-
            R5ch forces mate very soon, in the second B-B7ch, followed by B-
            Kt5ch or B-R3ch, wins the Queen.

          <p>White: Leonhardt. Black: Marshall.</p>
          <p>Falkbeer Counter Gambit (compare p. 35).</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 1. P-K4 P-K4

            5. QxP Kt-KB3
            6. Kt-QB3</p>
          <p>It would be quite bad to play P-B4 and try to hold the extra pawn
            at the expense of development. Black would very soon occupy the
            King&rsquo;s file with his Rook and there would be no time for White to
            bring his King into safety, e.g. 6. P-B4, B-QB4; 7. Kt-KB3,
            Castles; 8. B-K2, R-K1, and already now there are threats of Kt-
            K5 or Kt-Kt5 followed by B-B7ch or Kt-B7.</p>
          <h5> 6. … B-QB4
            7. B-Q2</h5>
          <p>White would of course like to continue with B-K3 in order to make
            a fight for the possession of the diagonal. He would, however,
            lose his chance of castling through Black&rsquo;s Q-K2. This is
            detrimental in all such cases where the lines in the centre are
            open or likely to be forced open at any time.</p>

            11. B-K3?
          </p>
          <p>White has not yet completed his development, and his first care
            should be to bring out his KKt. This he could have done without
            difficulty, thus: 11. BxB, KtxB; 12. Kt-R3. After the move in
            the text, Black not only occupies the King&rsquo;s file but gains a
            move in so doing.</p>

            flaw in White&rsquo;s position, namely the exposed KBP, and this tells
            in the ending.</p>
          <h5> 14. P-KR3</h5>
          <p>Now the square at KKt3 is unprotected, and this is serious in
            view of a probable Knight&rsquo;s ending, where, moreover, it will
            sooner or later be necessary to play P-KKt3 in order to support
            the KBP. Both the KKtP and KBP would be weak, with the King on
            the other wing, and be under constant threat of being captured.
            The game does proceed as indicated, and the simple and logical
            manner in which Marshall brings home his advantage in a very
            short time shows convincingly how fatal a shattered pawn position
            can be for the end-game. Instead of the move in the text, White
            should have played BxB followed by Kt-B3, which would have
            completed his development without making another pawn move.</p>

          <p>making a loophole for the King. In this case the move is correct,
            as the threat of mate ties the Black Rook to his rank. It is
            wrong to make a loophole, as weak players are fond of doing, as
            early as possible &ldquo;in case,&rdquo; before it is shown that there will
            be a need for it, or that there will be a Rook ending.</p>
          <h5> 20. P-R3</h5>
          <p>White is afraid of playing 20. QxP on account of Kt-Kt5, which
            threatens KtxBP followed by Q-QB3. 21. QxP would not be a
            sufficient defence because of Q-B4 threatening mate, and on the
            other hand 21. Q-R4 would conjure up a dangerous attack,
            beginning with P-QKt4. When the players castle on different
            wings, there is always the danger of the opponent sacrificing
            pawns and opening up files for his Rooks and Q against the
            castled King. The game then assumes a wild character, and as
            matters are generally settled one way or another in the middle-
            game, end-game considerations, both with regard to number and
            position of pawns, can be disregarded. Experience has shown that
            the player who develops his attack first is likely to win, and
            that it is of little use to submit tamely to an assault of this
            kind without attempting a counter attack.</p>
          <p>Such games are very difficult for the beginner to understand.
            There is about them something violent and difficult to estimate,
            and years of practice are necessary in order to gain the judgment
            required for weighing up the possibilities of attack and counter
            attack, where the Kings have castled on opposite wings.</p>

            25. Kt-K2 K-B1</p>
          <p>The Black King now pushes forward irresistibly, and attacks the
            weakened pawns on the King&rsquo;s wing. The White King cannot get any
            nearer, as a check by the Black Kt would win a pawn at once. The
            end is easy.</p>

            5. Q-B3</p>
          <p>It is contrary to the principles governing sound play to bring
            out the Queen early in the game. The opponent frequently has an
            opportunity of gaining a move by driving off the Queen,
            developing a minor piece at the same time. In the present case
            Black might have gained the advantage in the following way: 5.
            … Q Kt-B3. Now if: 6 KtxKt then Kt-Q5!; 7 Q-Q3?, PxKt; 8 QxP?,
            B-KB4. If, however, 6 B-Kt5, Black obtains the better game by
            playing 6. … KtxKt; 7 KtPxKt, Q-R5ch; 8 P-Kt3, Q-K5ch; 9 QxQ,
            PxQ; 10 BxKtch, PxB, with two Bishops on open diagonals. There is
            no harm in the doubled pawn, as White cannot attack it. Black&rsquo;s
            immediate threat is B-R3 or KB4, which exerts pressure at Q6, and
            White will find it difficult to advance his QP.</p>
          <h5> 5. … P-KB4</h5>
          <p>This move is open to discussion, as the Kt which it means to
            support can be driven away by P-Q3. On the other hand, if White
            does play his QP to Q3, Black can prevent its further advance by
            P-Q5, after which the White KP is insecure and the KB somewhat
            shut in.</p>

          <p>White offers his QBP in order to be able to strengthen his centre
            by P-Q4, and to free his pieces. To protect his QBP would be
            inferior, e.g. 8 Kt-K2, Kt-B3 or 8 B-Kt2?, PxP; 9 BxP, B-Kt5!; 10

          <p> 8. … PxP?</p>
          <p>It would have been better, of course, to continue developing with
            Kt-B3, which at the same time maintains the pressure on Q5.

            on which the White Bishop can soon operate. The game is

            or Castles tends to a draw from the very first, and is thought
            dull.</p>
          <p> 4. … Kt-B3</p>
          <p>Black can avoid the exchange of pawns, which White tries to bring
            about after P-Q4, by playing his Queen to K2. This covers his KP
            a second time, and White&rsquo;s P-Q4 can be answered with B-Kt3.
            White&rsquo;s QBP then obstructs the Kt&rsquo;s natural development. In a
            game von Schewe-Teichmann (Berlin, 1907) the position discussed
            on p. 117 was reached after the following moves: 5. Castles, P-
            Q3; 6. P-Q4, B-Kt3; 7. P-QR4, P-QR3; 8. P-R5, B-R2.</p>

          <h5> 7. B-Q2</h5>
          <p>The pawn sacrifice by 7. Kt-B3, KtxKP; 8. Castles! is much more
            interesting and more in keeping with the spirit of the opening.
            [Footnote: The following two short games will give an idea of the
            various lines of attack which are to be found in this opening:</p>
          <p>a. Howell-Michell (cable match, England—America, 1907): 8. …
            BxKt; 9. P-Q5 (Moller attack), B-B3; 10. R-K1, Kt-K2; 11. RxKt,
            P-Q3; 12. B-Kt5, BxB; 13. KtxB, B-B4 (the only chance of a draw
            would be this: Castles; 14. KtxRP, KxKt; 15. QR5ch, K-Kt1; 16. R-
            R4, P-KB4!; 17. B-K2, Kt-Kt3!; 18. Q-R7ch, K-B2; 19. R-R6, Kt-B5;
            20. B-R5ch, KtxB; 21. Q-Kt6 with perpetual check); 14. Q-B3,Q-Q2
            (BxR; 15. QxPch followed by Q-K6ch and QxB); 15. B-Kt5!, QxB; 16.
            QxB, P-KB3; 17. QR-K1, PxKt; 18. RxKtch and mate in a few moves.</p>
          <p>b. X v. Y, first 10 moves as before: 11. RxKt, Castles; 12. P-Q6,
            PxP 13. B-KKt5, Kt-B4; 14. Q-Q5!, BxB; 15. KtxB, Kt-R3 (QxKt; 16.
            QxPch); 16. Q R-K1, resigns.] White obtains a quick development
            and prevents Black from freeing his game by playing P-Q4. After
            8. … BxKt; 9. P-Q5 follows (Moller attack), and after 9. … B-
            B3, White wins back his piece by R-K1 (10. PxKt would not be
            good, as Black could free his game by KtPxP and P-Q4). On the
            other hand, after 8. … KtxKt; PxKt, White in addition gains a
            move, as BxP is countered by Q-Kt3.</p>
          <p>As played here, Black succeeds in playing P-Q4, and the game is
            even. Indeed the isolated QP is a weakness in the White position.</p>
          <p> 7. … BxBch<br />
            8. QKtxB P-Q4!<br />
            9. PxP KKtxP<br />
            10. Q-Kt3 QKt-K2<br />
            11. Castles KR Castles<br />
            12. KR-K1 P-QB3
          </p>
          <p>Now the Knight is securely posted in the centre, and Black can
            accumulate forces for the attack on the White QP, possibly by Q-
            Kt3, R-Q1 and Kt-B4.</p>
          <h5> 13. P-QR4</h5>
          <p>in order to drive the Queen from her Kt3, but this advance is
            &ldquo;three-edged,&rdquo; as Master Gregory would say, and the pawn is sure
            to prove weak in the end-game.</p>

            14. Q-R3 B-K3
            15. P-R5 Q-B2
            16. Kt-K4</p>
          <p>Kt-KKt5 would seem to be stronger here. B-B4 would then be
            answered by 17. B-Q3. After BxB, 18. QxB, White obtains
            opportunities for a King&rsquo;s side attack, in which the Rook could
            co-operate via K4 and Kt4 or R4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%"> 16. … QR-Q1
            17. Kt-B5 B-B1
            18. P-KKt3?</p>
          <p>This produces weak points at KB3 and KR3, and there being as yet
            no definite threat in Black&rsquo;s Kt-B5, should have been avoided. It
            is of course difficult to formulate a plan of attack, for there
            is no weak place in Black&rsquo;s armour. In any case White could
            safely have played QR-Q1 and Q2 in order to double the Rooks on
            the King&rsquo;s file or Queen&rsquo;s file according to circumstances. But
            now as soon as a Rook moves to Q1—and that will have to be done
            in the end, to support the weak QP—Black&rsquo;s B-Kt5 might become
            awkward.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 18. … Kt-B4

          <p>Kt-K5 would be answered by KR-Q1; 26. KtxP, KtxP threatening both

          <p>Now Black foregoes his well-earned advantage. He overlooks
            White&rsquo;s subtle move 28. P-R6. 26 Q-B1 was indicated. White&rsquo;s
            Queen&rsquo;s Pawn could not escape, and there was time to dislodge the
            White Rook from the seventh by R-Q2, e g. 26. … Q-B1; 27. Q-

          <p>The pawn threatens to queen. Taking the Rook&rsquo;s pawn would not be
            so good, as it would displace the Knight. White would not only
            regain the pawn easily with Kt-K3, but would also get his King
            into play.</p>
          <p> 34. Kt-K1 R-K1</p>
          <p>Here R-QB1 affords winning possibilities for Black. On account
            of the threat of R-B8, the exchange of Knights by White would be
            forced, and his game would have been badly cramped by the Black
            KBP, e.g. 34. … R-QB1; 35. KtxKt, PxKt; 36. R-R1 (K-K1?, R-B7;

          <h5> 5. … P-Q3</h5>
          <p>Here Black might have played P-Q4 at once. For if White takes the
            pawn, he leaves Black in possession of the pawn in the centre. If
            he does not do so but plays B-QKt5 instead, Black&rsquo;s reply would
            be Q-K2 and the exchange of pawns at K 5 would follow. White&rsquo;s P-

          <p>P-K5 would seem to be better, as it opens a diagonal for the KB,
            and a diagonal, too, for the QB, as White has to exchange the
            pawns. Indeed Black would soon have obtained a winning advantage,

            aiming at rapid development in return, after 6. … PxP; 7. KtxP.
            But Black can frustrate this plan either by pushing his pawn to
            Q6, so that the QKt is barred from the square B3, or by playing
            B-KKt5 with this probable continuation: 7. Q-Kt3, BxKt; 8. BxPch,
            K-B1; 9. PxB, Kt-B3, and Black has the better game, for White&rsquo;s

          <p>This is the typical position in the Max Lange attack. With his
            ninth move White threatened to win a piece by KtxB and Q-R5ch.
            Black could not parry the threat by 9. … Q-Q3, on account of
            PxP followed by Kt-K4-B6ch. The position in the diagram appears
            to be favourable for Black, as all his minor pieces are in play,
            whilst White&rsquo;s development is somewhat restricted by Black&rsquo;s
            strong pawns at QB5 and Q5. For a long time this opening has not
            been played in tournaments, being considered unsatisfactory for
            White. With the present game, and his new move of 15. B-R6,
            Marshall has reopened the question as to whether White&rsquo;s attack
            on the K file plus the pawn at KKt7 is sufficiently tempting.</p>

            11. QKt-K4 Castles QR</p>
          <p>This is imperative. If Black retires the Bishop from his unsafe
            position, White permanently prevents Black from castling, which
            is bound to be fatal in view of the open K file—e.g. 11. … B-
            Kt3; 12. PxP, R-KKt1; 13. P-KKt4, Q-Kt3; 14. KtxB, PxKt; l5. B-

          <p> 12. KtxQB</p>
          <p>If White tries to win the exchange in the following way: 12. P-
            KKt4, Q-K4!; 13. Kt-KB3, Q-Q4; 14. PxP followed by Kt-B6, Black
            can initiate a promising counter attack by 14. … BxP!!; 15.
            PxR-Q, RxQ; 16. Kt-B6, QxKt; 17. QxQ, BxQ. In this case White
            exposes his King&rsquo;s side by P-KKt4 in order to benefit from the
            unstable position of the Black KB, but unless care is taken, he
            can easily fall a victim to an attack on the open KKt file</p>

          <p>This is Marshall&rsquo;s innovation. It gets the Bishop out of play, as
            P-Kt5 must necessarily follow, yet the pawn at Kt7 holds the
            Black Rook, and there is a permanent threat of Kt-B6 either
            winning the exchange or, if the Knight is taken, giving White a

            B-K2, with R-Q2, Kt-Q1-B2. Instead of this, his next few moves do
            not reveal any concerted plan, and he loses in a surprisingly

            double exchange. An alternative to the text move is B-Kt3. Q-B3,
            however, has the advantage of developing a piece, and although it
            is the Queen, White has no early opportunity of driving the same
            off, such as he often obtains when the Queen comes out so soon in
            the game.</p>

          <p>Out of three possible moves, Lasker selects the one which
            contributes most to development. B-Kt3 does nothing in that
            direction, and BxB would bring the White Knight further into
            play. The text move prepares the development of the B at Kt2 with
            the option of Castles QR. If White exchanges Bishops he gives up
            the command of his Q4. Black&rsquo;s P-Q3 might have had the same
            result, but then the exchange would have given White a majority
            of pawns on the K side, whilst White&rsquo;s three Q side pawns would
            have held the black Q side pawns, one of the latter being
            doubled.</p>
          <p> 8. Kt-Q2 Q-Kt3</p>
          <p>The exchange of Bishops allows White to play Kt-K3, thus avoiding

          <p>Black threatens to play K-R1 in order to play P-B4. White&rsquo;s
            position would then be very bad, and therefore he rightly decides
            to anticipate the move, even at the cost of a pawn. In order to
            gain the QBP Black must waste a number of moves with the Q, and
            White gains time for a King&rsquo;s side attack. The pawn sacrifice is

            BxKt; 14. PXB, P-B3 regaining the pawn and maintaining positional
            advantage. White has therefore no alternative but P-B3, which

          <p>At last White can castle. He can, of course, only castle on the

            games in which the Kings castle on different wings are more or
            less beyond calculation, as pointed out before. On the whole, the
            player who first attacks wins. But experience has shown that the
            Queen&rsquo;s side is more difficult to defend on account of its
            greater expanse, and this theory is supported by the present
            game. In addition, White&rsquo;s development is not completed yet,
            whilst all the Black forces are ready to strike.</p>

          <p>Storming the position with pawns is peculiar to this kind of

            and to open files for the Rooks. Pawns are cheap in such cases.
            Open lines for the pieces are the things that matter, and the
            fewer pawns there are left, the more open lines are available for
            the attack.</p>

          <p>The idea underlying this pawn sacrifice is to open the K file for
            the Rook. It will be seen that, with correct play, Black manages
            to castle just in time, and White, though winning back his pawn,
            has no advantage in position. The opening is seldom played by
            modern masters.</p>
          <p>Instead of the move in the text, White can hardly defend the KP
            with Kt-B3, as Black simply captures the pawn and recovers his
            piece by P-Q4, with a satisfactory position. It is even better
            for Black if White plays 6. BxPch in reply to 5. … KtxP. The
            capture of White&rsquo;s KP is far more important than that of the
            Black KBP, particularly as the White Bishop, which could be
            dangerous on the diagonal QR2-KKt8, is exchanged, e.g. 6. …
            KxB; 7. KtxKt, P-Q4; 8. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Kt1! Black continues P-KR3,
            K-R2, R-B1 and has open lines for Rooks and Bishops.</p>
          <p> 4. … KtxP</p>
          <p>Black can, of course, develop his B-B4. Then he must either
            submit to the Max Lange attack (5. P-Q4, PxP) or play BxP, giving
            up the useful B, in which case he loses the pawn gained after 6.

          <p>
            This attack has been analysed extensively by Steinitz. The
            only square where the Queen cannot be attacked at once by the
            minor pieces is at QI. After 8. … Q-QI, Black obtains quite a
            satisfactory game: 9. RxKtch, B-K2; 10. KtxP, P-B4. This is
            Pillsbury&rsquo;s move, intending to displace the Rook. Black has then
            open lines for his two Bishops as compensation for his shattered
            pawn position. 11. R-KB4, Castles; 12. KtxKt, QxQch; 13. KtxQ,
            PxKt. Now it is not easy to find a reasonable plan for White, as
            Black threatens to cramp White&rsquo;s game with B-Q3 and P-B5. It is
            therefore necessary for White to take measures against that by
            playing R-B4 and B-B4. If Black still plays B-Q3, B-B4 follows,
            with the intention of exchanging and of provoking Black&rsquo;s P-B4,
            which leaves the QP &ldquo;backward.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>Now White is ahead with his development, having both Rooks in
            play and his Queen better placed. Nor can the latter be attacked
            by R-Q1, as White would simply play QxR. On the Queen being
            driven away by the Black Knight, he exchanges the latter and
            plays the Queen back into the same dominating position,
            eventually producing a dislocation of the Black Queen&rsquo;s side
            pawns.</p>

          <p>It is instructive to watch how this very slight weakness created
            by Black&rsquo;s advance of his pawns brings him into trouble. A White
            Knight settles down at his Q6, which is no longer guarded by the
            Black QBP, and paralyses the whole of Black&rsquo;s game. Another
            factor in White&rsquo;s superiority of position is the possession of
            the King&rsquo;s file. The Black Rook cannot move until the King gets a
            loophole by a pawn move. As we have seen, such a pawn move often
            affords an entry to the opposing pieces.</p>
          <h5> 20. P-KB4 B-B1</h5>
          <p>Not BxP, of course, because of P-QKt3 and Q-Kt2. The Bishop
            which cannot remain at K3 is to go to Kt2, so that the threat of
            mate after Q-QB3 may also hold up a White piece.</p>

          <p>Compulsory, as otherwise P-B6 forces the KtP to advance, which is
            fatal in any case. After P-Kt3, White would cover his BP and play
            his Q to KR6. On the other hand, after PxP there is Kt-R5-B6, and
            Black is in a mating net.</p>

            25. Kt-Q6 B-B3</p>
          <p>The threat was QxRch and R-K8 mate.</p>
          <h5> 26. P-KR3</h5>
          <p>in order to retreat to R2 in case of Q-Q8ch. In a way P-KR3
            creates a certain weakness, as the square at Kt3 is now
            defenceless, but Black has no pieces with which to take advantage
            of it: his Rook cannot move, his Bishop is on the White squares.
            If Black had a KB instead, the move would be very doubtful,
            because then Black might break in through White&rsquo;s KKt3.</p>
          <h5> 26. … P-B5</h5>
          <p>White&rsquo;s threat was to repel the Black Queen by P-B4 and to mate
            in five moves, beginning with Q-K6ch.</p>

          </div>
          <p>This disposes of the winning of the Queen by the threatened mate.
            But it creates a weakness at Black&rsquo;s Kt3, which White exploits in
            grand style. He decides to play the King himself to Kt6,
            threatening mate at Kt7. In spite of several raids by the Black
            Queen, this quaint device is crowned with success. The weakness
            created by P-KR3 could not be demonstrated more drastically.</p>

          <p>After the exchanges the position is clearly in favour of White.
            Against an undeveloped B, which also hampers a Rook, his Knight
            is mobile. The Black Queen&rsquo;s side pawns are weak, and give White
            winning chances even if Black succeeds in playing P-Q4 and

            those that surround the Black King, always taking care that Black
            does not free his Queen&rsquo;s side meanwhile. His pieces will then
            break in easily, and Black is forced to look on passively.</p>

          <p>By exchanging the Bishop White could not prove P-QR3 to be a lost
            move, for Black, by retaking with the QP, obtains open lines for
            Q and QB, and in addition to an easy development, retains two
            Bishops. This is a set-off against a certain weakness in Black&rsquo;s
            game, which may be found in the fact that after P-Q4, PxP, White
            has four pawns to three on the King&rsquo;s side, while his three pawns
            on the Queen&rsquo;s side are able to hold the four opposing pawns, one
            of which is doubled. But this weakness can only tell in the end-
            game, which is too far ahead for practical purposes, and to which
            it may not come at all. An example of the usual line of play will
            be found in Game No. 18.</p>

          </div>
          <p> 8. … Castles</p>
          <p>In Capablanca&rsquo;s opinion Black should not castle before White&rsquo;s
            intentions in the centre have been made clear. It makes a great
            difference whether White plays his QP to Q4 or to Q3 only.</p>
          <p>If after 8. … QKt-R4; 9. B-B2, P-B4 White plays: 10. P-Q4, his
            intention is to move his pawn further to Q5 as soon as Black has
            castled, and then to attack on the King&rsquo;s wing with QKt-Q2-B1-K3,
            P-KKt4 and Kt-B5. For this reason Black should force White to
            disclose whether he intends to exchange his QP or to advance it
            to Q5. In the latter case Black can refrain from castling
            altogether and counter-attack on the King&rsquo;s wing, e.g., 10. P-Q4,
            Q-B2; 11. P-KR3, B-Q2; 12. QKt-Q2, R-QB1; if now: 13. P-Q5 then
            P-R3 followed by P-Kt4-Kt5 gives Black many chances. If on the
            contrary 13. PxP, then Black need no longer fear an attack on the
            King&rsquo;s side after he has castled, as his Rooks will have a
            favourable opportunity for operating on the open Queen&rsquo;s file.
            However, there is still the disadvantage for Black of having
            advanced Queen&rsquo;s side pawns, which are liable to attack (P-QR4).</p>
          <p>The game takes a different course when Black exchanges the pawns
            in the centre. The continuation would then be: 11. … Kt-B3;
            12. Q Kt-Q2, B-Q2; 13. Kt-B1, PxP; 14. PxP, PxP; 15. B-Kt5, Q-
            Kt3. It is difficult to decide which side has the advantage.
            Black has an extra pawn, but White has the initiative.</p>
          <p>If in Diag. 116, after 8. … Castles White plays 9. P-Q4 at
            once, Black has an opportunity for the following interesting
            attack: 9. P-Q4, B-Kt5; 10. B-K3, KtxKP; 11. B-Q5, Q-Q2; 12.
            BxKKt, P-Q4; 13. B-B2, P-K5 14. P-KR3, B-R4; 15. Kt-K5, BxQ; 16.
            KtxQ, BxB; 17. KtxR, RxKt. White cannot take advantage of his
            Rooks, as there is no open file, whilst Black threatens to
            initiate a strong attack with P-B4.</p>
          <p>Aljechin has analysed a variation of this line of play, which he
            thinks leads finally to White&rsquo;s advantage: 12. PxP, Kt-Kt4; 13.
            BxKt, BxB; 14. P-KR3, BxKt; 15. QxB, KtxP; 16. RxKt, PxR; 17.
            BxR, B-B8; 18. Kt-R3, Q-Q7. I doubt that White can win this game.
          </p>
          <h5> 9. P-Q3</h5>
          <p>In this less aggressive continuation, in which nothing is
            immediately attempted against Black&rsquo;s centre, White prepares
            gradually for a King&rsquo;s side attack, as in this game with Kt-Q2-
            B1-Kt3. But Black should obtain time for operations in the
            centre.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 9. … Kt-QR4
            10. B-B2 P-B4
            11. QKt-Q2 Kt-B3
            12. P-QR4</p>
          <p>In many variations of the Ruy Lopez, this advance is always good,
            if Black cannot avoid exchanging the pawn, because the White
            Queen&rsquo;s Rook, which only gets into play with difficulty, can
            either be exchanged or hold the Rook&rsquo;s file. In any case the
            Black Knight&rsquo;s pawn is weak for the end-game. If, as in the
            present game. Black can play P-Kt5, P-R4 is useless and even
            doubtful, as the Rook&rsquo;s pawn itself may become weak in the end-
            game.</p>
          <p> 12. … B-Kt2</p>
          <p>This causes the loss of the game. In the Ruy Lopez the Bishop is
            nearly always needed on the diagonal QB1-KR6, to prevent a Knight
            from settling at White&rsquo;s KB5, which otherwise cannot be repelled
            except by P-KKt3, a most undesirable consummation. The proper
            continuation would have been P-Kt5, B-K3, Q-B2 and P-Q4,
            capturing the Queen&rsquo;s file. Compare note to move 13 in the next
            game.</p>

          </div>
          <p>Here is the weakness. White first provides against Black&rsquo;s P-Q4,
            and then starts a sharp attack on the King&rsquo;s side.</p>
          <p> 15. B-Kt5 QR-Q1</p>

          <p>The proper continuation is the one outlined in the note above.</p>

          <p>Black seeks salvation in exchanges, which White, of course, tries
            to avoid, having good prospects of driving home his attack. His
            pieces are concentrated on the King&rsquo;s side, whilst the Black
            forces are scattered, and unable to get back in time for the
            defence. Moreover, it is likely that the weakness at Black&rsquo;s KR3
            and KB3 will prove fatal as the Black KB is exchanged.</p>

            centre with P-Q4 in order to prevent Black&rsquo;s P-Q4 would be

          <p>In a game between Riga and Berlin PxP was tried for the first
            time, a bold venture which anticipates White&rsquo;s desire to open the
            King&rsquo;s file. After 7. R-K1 Black can defend the Kt by P-Q4, but
            after 8. KtxP White threatens again to win the Kt by P-KB3,
            besides attacking the QKt a second time. However, Black has a
            surprising answer in readiness. He initiates a violent counter
            attack which keeps White busy until Black, by castling, escapes
            the dangers of the double pin. (Compare Game No. 17.)</p>

            Bishop by P-B5. 8. PxP followed by P-B3 is the natural
            continuation, as shown in the first part of this book, because
            the Bishop, retreating to B2, can operate on a useful diagonal.</p>
          <p> 8. … QKtxP!</p>
          <p>QR-Kt1 would not be so good, because White obtains an open file
            for his Rook. The move in the text is an absolutely valid
            defence, as was proved by Schlechter in his match against Lasker.</p>

            providing a retreat for his R or B. After the move in the text
            this manœuvre becomes impossible, because the B after P-B3 can
            be attacked twice but has lost the support of the Queen.</p>

            The sequel forms an instructive example of how superior
            development can afford winning chances even when there is no
            immediate prospect of material gain. The opposing pieces are
            gradually constricted until the defending lines are weakened by
            compulsory pawn moves. In the present position Black quietly sets

            followed by Q-Kt4.</p>

            <p class="caption">Diag. 122</p>
          </div>
          <p>This is one of the most important positions in the Ruy Lopez.
            Black has the better development, but his centre is less secure.
            Whilst White has a pawn secured in the centre, Black has a Knight
            there which will soon be driven away. White&rsquo;s Q4, the basis of
            his centre, is entirely in his hands, while Black&rsquo;s Q4 is exposed
            to a steady pressure by the White pieces. Finally Black&rsquo;s Q Kt is
            unfavourably placed, obstructing as it does the QBP and
            preventing it from falling into line with its fellows. In
            Petrograd, 1909, Lasker tried the following new defence: Kt-B4
            followed by B-Kt5, giving up the moves gained before in order to
            relieve the pressure on the Black QP and to exchange the same
            ultimately at Q5. The various possibilities of the position have
            been discussed in connection with Diag. 22. It may be added that
            after 10. … Castles; QKt-Q2 is surely a better move than the
            usual Kt-Q4, as the Queen&rsquo;s side should be developed before
            undertaking an attack (11. … Q-Q2?; 12. KtxB, followed by
            RxKt). For a long time it was thought that after Kt-Q4 Black had
            to exchange Knights, which enables White to make the pawn at QB7
            &ldquo;backward&rdquo; by B-K3. For Black must first play P-KR3 to guard his
            Kt against the threat of P-B3 and P-KR4. However, a sensational
            innovation which refutes the Kt&rsquo;s move was introduced in Breslau
            in 1912. It is the following sacrifice: 10. … Castles; 11. Kt-
            Q4, KtxKP!; 12. P-B3, B-Q3!!; 13. PxKt, B-Kt5!!; 14. Q-Q2, Q-R5
            with an overpowering attack.</p>

            12. Q Kt-Q2 Castles
            13. Kt-Kt3 Kt-K5</p>
          <p>Here Lasker played Kt-K3 against Janowski (Paris, 1912), but it
            proved to be inferior, because 14. Q-Q3 disorganises Black&rsquo;s
            King&rsquo;s side forcibly.</p>
          <p>The move in the text is not really a pawn sacrifice. After 14.
            BxKt, PxB; 15. QxQ, QRxQ; 16. KKt-Q4, KtxKt; 17. KtxKt, R-Q4,
            White cannot play 18. RxP, because of P-QB4; 19. Kt-B2, B-B4 or
            19. Kt-B3, R-Q8ch; 20. Kt-K1, B-B4; 21. R-K2, B-Q6; 22. R-K3, B-

            16. Q-Q3 Kt-K5?</p>
          <p>This loses the QBP, and weakens the QP. Black might have tried
            BxKt; 17. QxB, B-Q3. It would then have been possible to support
            the QP by P-B3 after moving the Kt away. If Black was anxious to
            preserve his two Bishops he would even have risked P-Kt3. After
            17. B-R6, R-B2, the Bishop could have been driven away again by
            the KKt from Kt1 or Kt5. The open file offered some compensation
            and chances of counter attack.</p>
          <p> 17. BxP Q-Q2</p>
          <p>Not QxB because of QxPch.</p>

          <p>Now RxP! was feasible with a level game after: 22. RxKt, B-B4!
            23. KxR, BxR; 24. Q any, Q-B4ch, followed by BxB. After missing
            this chance, Black soon loses the game.</p>

            24. Kt-Q2 KtxKBP</p>
          <p>A last and desperate attempt. Black obtains Rook and pawn against
            two minor pieces, but has no time to initiate an attack with the
            Rooks. The wisest plan was to give up the P, with a view to
            effecting the exchange of the minor pieces, because an ending
            with Queen and Rooks generally produces a draw. Black could not
            play KtxKtP instead of the move in the text because of 25. B-

            KtxP (B3); 13. Kt-Kt5), and experience has shown that White

            defence of the K side, where White&rsquo;s attack becomes virulent. He

            retains his Bishop for the coming onslaught and speedily
            concentrates his forces on the K side; whilst Black, who has won
            a pawn at the expense of several moves, cannot mobilise an
            equivalent number of pieces in time for the defence.</p>

            8. KtxP B-Q3</p>
          <p>This is the key to the variation. Black threatens to obtain a
            draw by perpetual check through BxPch, followed by Q-R5ch and
            QxPch. This is not good enough against a weaker opponent in a
            tournament, and a strong player cannot afford to play the Riga
            defence. But that is not a point against the variation. To prove
            it unsound, White has to find a win.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 9. KtxKt BxPch
            10. K-R1!</p>
          <p>After 10. K-B1 Black has a tremendous attack, and drives it home
            before White can manage to bring his extra piece into play. A
            game Maroczy-Berger (Vienna, 1908) is an illustration of this. It
            continued in this way: 10. K-B1, Q-R5; 11. B-K3, Castles; 12. Kt-
            Q4, B-Kt5; 13. Kt-KB3, Q-R4. Now White has no satisfactory
            continuation. 14. Kt-Q2 obstructs the Queen, and it is difficult
            to bring the Rooks into concerted action. 14. Kt-B3, QR-Q1; 15.

          <p>It now looks as if White were lost. But a fine sacrifice forces

          </div>
          <p>After the terrible slaughter, the position is somewhat clearer.
            Black has a Rook and two pawns for two minor pieces, a slight
            advantage for the end-game, but as yet there is no thought of an
            end-game. White, in possession of two Bishops, with an open
            Queen&rsquo;s file on which the Black King stands, has good attacking
            chances, and most masters would think the position favourable for
            White.</p>
          <h5> 14. … B-K3</h5>
          <p>P-KB4 is a plausible move, but is followed by a pretty mate by
            15. B-Kt5. The move in the text threatens to eliminate the KB by
            P-QB4, P-QKt4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 15. B-K3 P-KB4
            16. Kt-B3 K-K2
            17. P-KKt4</p>
          <p>Tarrasch recommends 17. R-Q1, threatening Kt-Q5ch. If P-B3,
            White could play 18. B-Kt6, thereby permanently preventing Black
            from contesting the Queen&rsquo;s file, and then try to exchange
            Black&rsquo;s B by Kt-K2-Q4. With two Bishops, White would then have
            winning chances.</p>
          <p>A subtle idea underlies White&rsquo;s move of P-KKt4. He wishes to take
            advantage of the fact that Black has exchanged the KB by playing
            P-Kt5, thus holding all the four pawns on the King&rsquo;s side. But
            Black finds a surprising reply, which seems to refute White&rsquo;s
            plan.</p>
          <p>Capablanca played against Ed. Lasker (New York, 1915), 17. P-
            KKt4, P-KKt3; 18. K-Kt3, P-KR4; 19. PxBP, P-R5ch; 20. K-R2, PxP;

            QR-Q1; 25. RxR, KxR; 26. Kt-K4, winning a pawn.

            18. P-Kt5 QR-KKt1!!</p>
          <p>Black offers the exchange in order to get rid of White&rsquo;s QB. If
            White accepts the sacrifice, he loses his KKtP, and Black retains
            three passed pawns for the piece, at least an equivalent for the
            end-game. White should decline the doubtful gift and meet the
            threat of P-R3 and P-KKt4 with 19. R-KKt1.</p>

          <p>Black need no longer fear to exchange Rooks, for he would then
            threaten the Queen&rsquo;s side pawns with his King whilst the passed
            pawns kept the White forces occupied.</p>

            a good game. In this opening Black is justified in assuming the
            initiative, as the exchange, which has opened a diagonal for his
            QB, has furthered his development. If he does not do so, and
            confines himself to defending tamely, the chances are that he
            will lose on account of White&rsquo;s majority of pawns on the King&rsquo;s
            side.</p>
          <p> 6. QxP QxQ</p>
          <p>Compulsory. If B-K3 instead, 7. B-B4 attacks QB7. B-Q3 in reply
            to that would be inferior. By exchanging Bishops White would
            render the Black QP &ldquo;backward,&rdquo; and on the open file its capture
            would be inevitable.</p>

          <p>Black prepares to castle on the King&rsquo;s side. It is more usual,
            and probably stronger, to castle on the Queen&rsquo;s side, as the King
            then protects the QBP, which in the present case would be weak if
            Black&rsquo;s KB were to be exchanged.</p>

          <p>Black allows his opponent too much latitude on the King&rsquo;s wing.
            He should prevent White&rsquo;s P-B5, which obstructs his QB, by P-KB4.
            After P-K5 the game would be equalised by B-B4, BxKt, and B-K3.
          </p>
          <p>A draw would then be practically certain, with the Bishops of
            opposite colours. Black probably thought White would not risk
            weakening his KP by P-B5. But with unfailing judgment Lasker
            foresees that, in consequence of the greater mobility of his
            pieces, his attack will be successful before a counter attack on
            the weak KP can be instituted.</p>
          <p> 11. Kt-Kt3 P-B3</p>
          <p>Even now P-KB4 was imperative, though it would keep the Bishop
            from that square. The continuation could have been 12. P-K5, B-
            Kt5; 13. Kt-K2 (or R4), Kt-Q4, and the Bishop is safe.</p>
          <h5> 12. P-B5!!</h5>
          <p>This move has a twofold aim. It shuts in the Bishop, and allows
            B-B4, exchanging the Black QB.

          <p> 12. … P-QKt3</p>
          <p>The diagonal QR1-KR8 is the only one in which the Bishop has any
            prospects of action. However, as soon as he relinquishes his
            present diagonal, a White Knight settles at K6 and the Black
            Rooks are very much hampered.</p>
          <p> 13. B-B4 B-Kt2</p>
          <p>Black should have exchanged the Bishops. Now he gets a weak pawn
            at Q3. Before playing B-Kt2, P-B4 should be played to prevent the
            Knight getting from Kt3-Q4-K6.</p>

            Q4, PxP; 8. B-Kt5.</p>

            <p class="caption">Diag. 128</p>
          </div>
          <p>The position is not unlike that in Diagram 90, and the same
            remarks apply to it. Here B-K3 is inadvisable, because P-Q4,
            threatening to fork two pieces, forces the exchange of Black&rsquo;s
            centre pawn. After 7. … B-Kt5; 8. Kt-Q5, Kt-Q5; 9. B-B4, B-B4,
            on the other hand, we get the position discussed on p. 115, in
            which White obtains the advantage by Q-Q2. Instead of 9. … B-
            B4, Black should play Q-Q2 with a similar threat. But he has not
            the cooperation of his King&rsquo;s Bishop for the attack, and White
            just manages to escape with a draw, e.g. 9. … Q-Q2; 10.
            KtxKtch, PxKt; 11. BxP, P-KR3(BxKt; 12. PxB, Q-R6 fails on
            account of K-R1 and R-KKt1); 12. P-B3, KtxKtch; 13. PxKt, B-KR4;
            14. K-R1, K-R2 (Diagram 129); 15. R-KKt1.</p>
          <div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

          <p class="noindent">
            This is the saving clause. If now Black had his B at B4, as White
            has in the corresponding attack, White would first have to
            protect his BP with 15 Q-K2, and would be lost after R-KKt1; 16.
            R-KKt1, R-Kt3; as 17. B-R4 fails because of Q-R6; 18. B-KKt3, R-
            B3; and on the other hand, after 17. RxR, PxR Black plays R-KB1,
            attacking the BP a second time.</p>
          <p>With the Black Bishop at Kt5, however, Black does not succeed.
            The continuation could be l5. … R-KKt1; 16. R-Kt3, R-Kt3; 17.
            B-R4, with a probable draw.
          </p>
          <p>This line of play is most difficult for both sides, and it has
            been avoided so far in tournaments.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 128 the favourite continuation for many years was: 7.
            … BxKt; 8. PxB, Kt-K2. The opening of the KKt file by 9. BxKKt
            is not to be feared, because of the reasons given when discussing
            Diagram 90. But White obtains the advantage with 9. Kt-R4,
            preparing the opening of the KB file by P-B4 and PxP. 9. … Kt-
            Kt3, in order to retake with the BP after 10. KtxKt and to open
            the file for Black&rsquo;s Rooks, is not a sufficient reply, because
            after 11. P-B4 and PxP White has a clear advantage, having an
            extra pawn in effect for the end-game. For the three Black pawns
            on the King&rsquo;s side are held by the two adverse pawns, which they
            cannot pass.</p>
          <p>The attempt to expel the troublesome Bishop after 9. … Kt-K1 by
            P-KB3, and then play for a centre by P-B3, Kt-B2 and P-Q4 fails
            on account of the withering attack which White obtains on the KB
            file, e.g. 9. … Kt-K1; 10. B-QB4, K-R1; 11. P-B4, P-KB3; 12. Q-
            R5, PxB; 13. PxP, etc.</p>
          <p>In consequence the defence by 7. … BxKt and Kt-K2 has been
            abandoned.</p>
          <p>In the present game Black reverts to a very old defence,
            comprising the moves: BxKt, Q-K2, Kt-Q1-K3. It had been abandoned
            because White, by playing R-K1, P-Q4, and eventually B-B1 and B-
            R3, forces the exchange of Black&rsquo;s centre pawn, and obtains an
            advantage, on well-known grounds. Here Black strengthens the
            defence by interpolating P-KR3!, after which White must come to a
            decision as to maintaining the pin. If he decides to do so the
            White Bishop will no longer be able to threaten the Black Queen
            from QR3.</p>

            8. PxB P-KR3
            9. B-KR4</p>
          <p>If the B retreats to B1 or K3, Black can adopt the defence Kt-K2-
            Kt3. Then Kt-R4 would be inferior, because Black can simply play
            P-KKt4. In this case the advance of the pawns is justified,
            because Black can bring his QKt to KKt3 and have practically one
            piece more on the King&rsquo;s side, and good prospects for the attack
            which he can open with K-R2, R-KKt1, Kt-Kt3-B5.</p>
          <h5> 9. … Q-K2</h5>
          <p>P-KKt4 would be premature. White would win at once by 10. KtxKtP,
            PxKt; 11. BxP, as he can attack the Knight a second time by P-KB4
            and PxP before Black can either protect it sufficiently or
            relieve the &ldquo;pin.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>In the end-game thus brought about the White Rooks have more
            freedom, as they can be mobilised easily on the third rank to act
            on either wing. Black&rsquo;s pawns, however, are stronger, being
            easily protected by the King, whilst White&rsquo;s weak pawns at QR2
            and QB2 are at too great a distance from the King; therefore
            White must see to it that Black does not open files for his Rooks

            it is advisable to retire the Bishop to R4 or B4, or else to play
            5. KtxKt, PxKt; 6. P-K5, PxKt; 7. PxKt. Black would then play QxP
            and not PxQPch, as the latter move allows White to develop
            quickly, and Black has no time to castle—e.g. 8. BxP, QxP; 9.

            Here KtxB was essential, followed by QxP, freeing the Bishop.

            P-KB3; 11. K-B1ch, K-B2), but after the exchange of Queens there
            is not much to fear from an immediate attack, and the value of
            the two Bishops soon asserts itself. In a match game Ed. Lasker-
            Cole (London, 1913) the continuation was 12. P-Q4, P-QR3; 13. Kt-
            B3, KtxKt; 14. PxKt, P-Q4. Here the doubled pawn is a
            disadvantage, in that the pawn at B2 is immobile, and constantly
            liable to be attacked by B-B4. P-Q3 was the better move.</p>
          <p> 7. Castles KtxKt</p>
          <p>Now KtxB was no longer possible. After KtxQKt there would be
            threats of KtxBP as well as of R-K1 and P-Q3. The game is almost

          <p>There was a threat of KtxB and KtxP. If Black plays P-Q3, the B
            must retire all the same after 5. B-Kt5. It seems best to retire
            the B to K2 rather than to B4 or R4, because there remains the
            threat of a pin subsequently by B-KKt5, which might become

          <p>The second mistake. Unimportant as it seems, it leads to the loss
            of the game. White did not defend the pawn by Q-B2, because it
            would have proved 10. Q-Q2 to have been a lost move. But giving
            up the centre is a far greater evil. Black now commands his Q5
            and KB5, and this enables him to start an attack to which there
            is no defence. The game shows conclusively how important it is to
            maintain the centre.</p>

          <p>So far the game is easy to understand in the light of the remarks
            made on page 44, when treating of the openings. The continuation
            shows in an instructive fashion that White&rsquo;s attack is the more
            effective, being directed against the King&rsquo;s side.</p>
          <p> 17. P-B5! KPxP</p>
          <p>This sacrifice of a pawn in conjunction with a second sacrifice

          <p>Now that White has made an opening for himself at KB6, the rest

            20 Kt-R 7, KR-Q1; 21 Kt-B6ch, after which White wins after either

          <p>If the Queen recaptures, White obtains too great an advantage in
            development, and therefore Black submits to the doubling of his
            pawns. It is doubtful if this means a handicap, although the
            King&rsquo;s side gets broken up. For Black keeps his two Bishops, a
            powerful weapon, unless White succeeds in developing swiftly an
            attack on the King&rsquo;s side. The present game is instructive and
            shows the chances afforded to both sides by the position brought
            about by the exchange at KB6.</p>
          <p> 6. KtxP P-KB4</p>
          <p>As the KB obtains a long diagonal at Kt2, this advance is
            justified. Otherwise there would be strong objections to it, as
            the pawn is likely to be subjected to attack, and apart from
            that, it gives up command of Black&rsquo;s K4.</p>
          <p> 7. Kt-QB3</p>
          <p>Kt-Kt3 would seem more natural, firstly, because Black has
            weaknesses on the K side, and White will need his pieces for
            attack in that quarter, and secondly, because the QP ought to be
            supported by P-B3, as Black will attack it by B-Kt2.</p>

            8. Kt-B3 Castles
            9. B-B4</p>
          <p>If now the Knight were at Kt3, White could play P-B3 and BQ3.
            This is the proper place for the B, which might obtain an open
            diagonal after P-KKt4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 9. … Kt-B3

            12. P-B3 P-QB5</p>
          <p>P-Kt3 seems preferable, as the text move releases the hold on
            White&rsquo;s Q4. The isolated pawn resulting after 13. PxP is not to
            be feared, as the B at Kt2 would have greater efficiency (QR-
            Kt1), and White would not be so firmly established in the centre.

            14. Q-Q2</p>
          <p>There now ensues an interesting struggle. White builds up an
            attack with Q and both Knights and eventually the B (P-KKt4). If
            Black can manage to play his King into safety at R1 in time, and
            then occupies the Kt file with his Rooks, he would have the
            better of it, his pieces having by far the greater range of
            action.</p>

          <p>White gains a move by attacking the Knight&rsquo;s Pawn. It may seem
            far fetched if I now point out that this could not have happened
            if from the first Black had given preference to the pawn
            formation at QKt3 and B4 instead of Kt4 and B5, though the whole
            game would almost certainly have taken a different course. Still,
            when advancing a pawn into an unprotected position there always
            is the risk of its becoming the object of an attack at an
            opportune moment, and whenever the plan of development does not
            necessitate such moves they are best avoided.</p>

          <p>The last moves have decided the game. Both players have
            overlooked that 20. Q-B6 would have won a pawn at least (QxQ,
            21. KtxQch with KtxB and BxP). 20. … BxKt leads to an immediate
            loss by 21. QxB, BxKt; 22. QxB followed by P-KKt4! with an
            overwhelming attack.</p>
          <p>Instead of 19. … Kt-B3, Black should have played P-B3, followed
            by K-R1 and the occupation of the Kt file by the Rooks. White&rsquo;s
            last move allows him to de this with even greater effect.</p>

          <p> 7. Kt-Kt5</p>
          <p>The intention is to strengthen the centre by P-QB3. Though it
            takes a number of moves to bring the Knight into play again, yet
            most of the tournament games in this variation have been won by
            White, mostly through a King&rsquo;s side attack on the lines set out
            in the notes to Game No. 22. Investigations by Alapin tend to
            show that this is due to the fact that Black in all cases devoted
            his attention to Queen&rsquo;s side operations (just as in Game No. 22)
            when he could have utilised White&rsquo;s backward development, by
            himself starting a counter attack on the King&rsquo;s side. He can then
            either aim at the White centre at once with P-KB3, or else play
            P-KB4 and prepare the advance of the KKtP by Kt-B3-Q1-B2. These
            various lines of play are still under discussion. Simple
            development is probably preferable to the move in the text, e.g.
            7. B-Q3, Castles; 8. P-B4, P-QB4; 9. Kt-B3.</p>
          <h5> 7. … K-Q1</h5>
          <p>There can be no advantage in forfeiting the option of castling
            unless there be no other way of getting the King into safety and
            of bringing the Rooks into concerted action. It is obvious that
            otherwise the free development of pieces is hindered, and the
            King is in appreciable danger, for it is easier to open files in
            the centre than on the wings where the pawns have not advanced
            yet. Therefore Kt-Kt3 is the only move worth considering.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 8. P-QB3 P-KB3
            9. PxP</p>
          <p>With the Black King remaining in the centre, White has no further
            interest in the maintenance of his pawn at K5. On the contrary he
            will try to clear the centre.</p>

          <p>At this early stage it is clear that Black will have to contend
            with difficulties in trying to complete his development. The
            usual way (P-QB4) is barred on account of the dangers to Black&rsquo;s
            King with which a clearance in the centre is fraught.</p>

          <p>As Black can force this advance at any time by playing R-KKt1,
            White decides to develop his KB at Kt2, thereby covering his KB3
            and KR3. The weakness of the latter squares would not be of any
            great moment if White were to castle on the Queen&rsquo;s wing. But as
            P-QB4 is necessary in order to break up the centre, castling KR
            is the right course.</p>

          <p>This line of defence, called the McCutcheon variation, was
            recommended for many years by Tarrasch as being the strongest.
            The most obvious continuation 5. P-K5 leads to complications, and
            the final verdict has not yet been reached. After 5. … P-KR3,
            the best continuation is thought to be: 6. PxKt, PxB; 7. PxP, R-
            Kt1; 8. P-KR4, PxP; 9. Q-R5, Q-B3; 10. QxRP, QxP.</p>
          <p>White has an easy development, whilst Black, as in most
            variations in the French defence, finds it difficult to bring his
            QB into play. After P-KR3, it is not advisable to retire the
            Bishop; 6. B-R4, P-KKt4; 7. B-Kt3, for here the Bishop is out of
            play, and Black&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s Knight being free can play to K5 for
            concerted action with Black&rsquo;s KB. Lasker&rsquo;s continuation in the
            present instance is at once simple and effective. It leads to an
            entirely different system of development.</p>
          <p> 5. PxP QxP</p>
          <p>If Black recaptures with the pawn, he must lose a move with the
            Bishop in order to avoid getting an isolated doubled pawn after
            6. Q-B3. The doubled pawn which Black may get after the move in
            the text would not be isolated, and therefore not necessarily
            weak. It could become a weakness if Black were to castle on the
            King&rsquo;s side. But otherwise it might even become a source of
            strength, supporting, as it would, an advance of Black&rsquo;s KP
            against the White centre.</p>
          <p> 6. Kt-B3 P-B4?</p>
          <p>Black should retain the option of castling QR, in case White
            exchanges at his KB6; P-QKt3 and B-Kt2 would have been better.</p>

          <p>guarding against the mate at Q1 before moving the Kt. But this
            would have been better effected by Q-K2. After Q-Kt3 the Knight
            cannot move yet because of B-Kt5ch.</p>

            the only reason for abandoning the centre by PxP was the
            occupation of the long diagonal by the QB. Now the Queen&rsquo;s side
            pieces cannot get into play without much difficulty, and by the

          <h5> 1. P-K4 P-QB4</h5>
          <p>This opening is called the Sicilian Defence. White, however,
            adopts a continuation which leads into a variation of the French
            Defence.</p>

            6. B-Q3 PxP</p>
          <p>Black seeks to demonstrate that White&rsquo;s QP is weak. The present
            game, however, seems to prove that White is able to guard it
            adequately, thus permanently supporting the KP too. It would
            therefore appear to be better to attack the KP itself, and to
            play P-B3 on the fifth move. Now B-Q2 would be better than the
            text move. As White cannot give further support to his Q4, he
            would have to play PxP, and the protection of the K5 would have
            to be undertaken by pieces, which is not desirable.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Now White&rsquo;s centre is safe from further attacks. True, White has
            forfeited castling, but as he dominates the King&rsquo;s side, where
            Black cannot undertake anything, there is no harm in P-Kt3,
            preparatory to &ldquo;artificial castling.&rdquo;</p>

          <p>This manœuvre is unwise; White counters with 13. P-QR4, a move
            which was necessary in any case, in order to develop the QKt via
            R3, this being the Knight&rsquo;s only chance of getting into play,
            because, as long as the QP is attacked three times the lines of B
            and Q must not be interrupted. That is a weakness in White&rsquo;s
            game, and it was necessary for Black to prevent his Kt being
            driven off by P-KKt4. P-KR4 was the correct move. Then White also
            had to play P-KR4 to prevent P-KKt4-5, in which case Black could
            have played l3. … P-KKt3, and have brought his Rooks into
            concerted action. P-KKt3 would have been necessary before
            castling, because White&rsquo;s B-Q3 would have attacked the KKt. The
            latter could not then capture the Queen&rsquo;s Pawn on account of a
            discovered check, e.g. l2. … Castles; 13 B-Q3, KtxP?; 14 KtxKt,
            KtxKt; 15 BxKt, QxB?; 16 B-R7ch, and QxQ.</p>
          <p>In Diagram 139 Black&rsquo;s P-QR4 is not only a lost move, but
            moreover allows a White piece to settle permanently at QKt5. It
            also prevents the Knight from playing to QR4, from where White&rsquo;s
            P-QR4 could be answered by Kt-Kt6 eventually.</p>

          <p>At first glance this move would seem to lose time, as it does
            nothing towards the main object of opening strategy, namely, the
            development of pieces. But we shall find that
            it does contribute to that aim, although indirectly. For one
            thing it could, by a transposition of moves, lead into an opening
            in which P-QB4 is played in any case; in other openings it is of
            use, in that it acts from the first against the formation of a
            strong white centre. Concurrently it prepares the opening of a
            file for the Rooks.</p>

            clear gain of a move. There are plenty of developing moves to
            choose from.</p>
          <p>Two systems of development can be followed by Black according to
            whether the KB is to develop at K2 or Kt2. In the first case
            (compare Game No. 29) P-K3 is played. In the second case, the
            opening might take this course: 2. … Kt-QB3; 3. P-Q4, PxP; 4.
            KtxP, Kt-B3; 5. Kt-QB3, P-Q3 (not P-KKt3 at once, because White
            would exchange Knights and drive off the KKt by P-K5); 6. B-K3,
            P-KKt3, and B-Kt2. White&rsquo;s position is superior, as he has a pawn
            in the centre in conjunction with greater mobility. Black will
            find it difficult to bring his QB into play. Nevertheless his
            position is compact and difficult to get at.</p>
          <h5> 3. P-K5</h5>
          <p>Undoubtedly Rubinstein had taken this move into account when
            playing 2. … Kt-KB3. His idea was to provoke the advance of the
            KP. The pawn at K5 is weaker than at K4, particularly as Black&rsquo;s
            QBP prevents its natural support by P-Q4. Moreover Black&rsquo;s Q4 is
            free from interference by White. White refutes this ultra
            subtilty by simple and straight-forward play, and he gets such an
            advantage in development that his attack succeeds before Black is
            able to demonstrate any weakness in White&rsquo;s game.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 3. … Kt-Q4
            4. Kt-B3 KtxKt
            5. QPxKt Kt-B3
            6. B-QB4 P-Q3</p>
          <p>After 6 … P-K3, 7. B-B4 would restrain the QP.</p>
          <p> 7. B-B4 PxP</p>
          <p>At this early stage Black has no satisfactory means of
            development. The QP is attacked three times, and therefore the KP
            cannot move, nor can the KB be developed at Kt2. B-Kt5, in order
            to play BxKt and PxP, is refuted by BxPch. The move in the text
            which brings about the exchange of Queens, but develops another
            White piece at the same time, is more or less forced. It is
            instructive to watch how White&rsquo;s advantage in development soon
            materialises.</p>

          <p>This comes to the same as Kt-B3, as after P-Q4, PxP the Knight
            recaptures. If, however, Black plays P-Q4 there is a certain
            advantage for White to have the Kt at K2, e.g. 3. … P-Q4; 4.
            PxP, PxP; 5. P-Q4. If now Black does not exchange pawns, White is
            able to bring his KB to bear on the centre after P-KKt3 and B-
            Kt2.</p>
          <p>3. … Kt-QB3</p>
          <p>White can exchange this Knight later on, and thus make P-K5
            possible as soon as he should deem it advisable to drive the
            Black Knight from his KB3, where the same is bound to develop
            sooner or later. It is perhaps wise to prevent P-K5 by Q-B2
            instead of the move in the text. This is an old defence,
            introduced by Paulsen. Though it retards the development of
            Black&rsquo;s minor pieces, it produces a strong defensive position,
            and the opening of the QB file gives attacking chances on the
            Queen&rsquo;s side. The defence might run like this: 3. … P-QR3; 4.
            P-Q4, PxP; 5. KtxP, Q-B2; 6. B-K3, Kt-KB3; 7. B-K2, B-K2; 8.

          <p>As White can force Black to play P-Kt3, a weakening move, by P-K5
            and Q-Kt4, Black should have played P-Kt3 at once, so as to have
            Kt-R4 in answer to P-K5, thus keeping one piece for the defence
            of the King&rsquo;s side. The latter is in jeopardy after the move in

            has no time to collect sufficient forces for the defence. The

          <p>This is to tempt White to play P-QB4, a weak move (see p. 35).
            By playing P-QB3 Black would obtain by far the better game in
            exchange for the pawn.</p>
          <p> 3. P-Q4 QxP</p>
          <p>KtxP can also be played. In either case White wins a move by
            driving off the Black piece by Kt-QB3 or P-QB4. Furthermore,
            White has a pawn in the centre. Black&rsquo;s plan in retaking with the
            Queen might be to castle early on the Queen&rsquo;s side and attack
            White&rsquo;s centre pawn by P-K4, and White must be on the alert
            against this plan, though it will not be easy for Black to put
            the same into execution, because of the exposed position of his
            Queen. After 4. Kt-QB3, Q-QR4 is the only move which brings the
            Queen into momentary security, and even then Black must provide
            for a retreat, as after White&rsquo;s B-Q2 there would be a threat of
            an advantageous &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; by the Kt. P-QB3 provides such a
            retreat, but it bars the QKt from its natural development at B3,
            where the Kt could exert further pressure on White&rsquo;s Q4. The QB,
            too, is difficult to get into play and easily becomes an object
            of attack, as in the present game.</p>

            game is as good as lost. White obtains a violent attack with

            find a sensible plan, as the White pieces have so little

          <p>The purpose of this move is not clear. The advance of the KtP
            could only be condoned by a desire to obtain an open file, and it
            seems illogical to protect it now. If White wanted to escape the
            pinning of his KKt he need not have moved the Queen. KtxKt would
            have effected this and prevented the King&rsquo;s side from being laid
            bare.</p>
          <p>White&rsquo;s game would still have been bad, particularly as the
            exchange at Q4 opens the diagonal for the Black KB, but the move
            in the text has even a worse effect. Mieses concludes the game

          <p>A deep conception. If White accepts the proffered sacrifice of a

            his Kt, and, moreover, the KR file being open, he can only castle
            on the Q side. But there the Black Queen is ready for the attack.
            If he refuses the sacrifice, the text move is still of value, as
            even then it is hardly advisable for White to castle on the K
            side, whilst Black can play B-R3 as soon as it might be desirable

          <p>There seems to be nothing alarming about the position, yet on
            closer investigation a number of vital failings can be discerned
            in Black&rsquo;s camp. The absence of a pawn in the centre and the
            unsatisfactory development have a far-reaching influence. White
            will be able to bring his forces to the King&rsquo;s side by way of K4,
            which is made accessible by the disappearance of Black&rsquo;s QP,
            before Black has time to bring his QB to bear on White&rsquo;s K4 by P-
            QKt3 and B-Kt2. White&rsquo;s immediate threat (after P-K5) is Q-K2-K4
            and B-Q3. If Black does not wish to risk P-KKt3, he must defend
            himself with R-K1, Kt-B1. In the meantime White can play R-Q1 and
            threaten P-Q5, opening the Queen&rsquo;s file. This again necessitates
            P-B3, which postpones the efficiency of the QB at Kt2 until
            White&rsquo;s QKt and QR have been brought up for the attack. The game
            develops on these lines, and provides an excellent example of the
            advantage of the command of the centre.</p>

          <p>Lasker has played this move successfully in his match against
            Marshall; but it has not come into general use. White should get
            the better game by 6. BxB, QxB; 7. Q-B2, KtxKt; 8. QxKt or 7.
            PxP, KtxKt; 8. PxKt, PxP; 9. Q-Kt3, in the first case because the
            Black QB is out of play, in the second case because of the open
            Kt file. 7. KtxKt is bad, because PxKt prevents the natural
            development of the KKt at B3, and Black can obtain an attack
            after castling by P-KB4-5.</p>

          <p>Giving up the centre pawn in this case is not against the spirit

          <p>This move can only be good if White intends to operate on the
            Queen&rsquo;s side, possibly by KR-Kt1 and P-R5. But the position of
            the White Queen makes the adoption of a different plan
            compulsory. For one thing, it is rational to concentrate forces
            where the Queen can take her share, therefore, in this case, on
            the King&rsquo;s side. On the other hand, the manœuvre referred to
            could not be put into execution here because Black can prevent P-
            R5 by P-QB4 and Kt-B3. A fairly obvious course was to play P-K4,
            taking possession of the centre. P-QB4 would then be answered by
            P-Q5, after which the White Rooks would be very effective at Q1
            and K1. In this game White does initiate a King&rsquo;s side attack

            same at once, thinking quite rightly that a direct attack must
            have good chances, as Black gets two pieces out of play in
            capturing the pawn.</p>

          <p>There is no need to play for violent complications. The logical
            course was to open the way to the King&rsquo;s side for the Rooks by P-
            K4. The continuation could have been: 20. P-K4, BxRP; 21. Kt-R5,
            P-Kt3; 22. P-K5, BxR; 23. RxB followed by Kt-B6, with a strong
            attack; also after 21. … P-B3, 22. R-Q2, White&rsquo;s attacking
            chances are good. After the move in the text, Black could get an
            advantage by simply exchanging: 20. … PxP; 21. KtxP, BxKt; 22.

          <p>Black must try to bring back his minor pieces for the defence. If

            the Queen&rsquo;s side.</p>

          <h5> 29. P-KR4</h5>
          <p>White&rsquo;s attacking resources seem inexhaustible. By exchanging
            Queens he could have got his pawn back in this way: 29. B-Q7, Q-
            B1 (R xB?, 30. Q-R6); 30. BxKt, BxB; 31. QxQP, Q-Q3; 32. Kt-
            Q7,QxQ; 33. KtxQ, B-K1; 34. KtxQBP. But even then Black would
            maintain a superiority in the end-game owing to the freedom of
            his passed pawn, and because he can post his Rook at the seventh
            after P-QKt4. This explains why Marshall prefers not to win back
            his pawn, but to enter upon a violent attack with a doubtful
            issue. However, Capablanca finds the right move in all the
            ensuing complications, and finally wins the game.</p>

          <p>This is much stronger than P-Q Kt3 and B-Kt2, as then the Black

          <p>Black intends to move his B and then to advance his KP with an
            attack on the Queen. The object of the text move is to prevent

          <p>By this exchange Black achieves his object of driving off the
            Knight by P-Q5, but White has time to give his RP further
            protection by P-QKt3, This, Black would have prevented by playing
            B-Kt4 instead of the text move, e.g. 21. P-B4, P-K4; 22. Q-B5,
            PxKt; 23. PxP, B-B3; 24. PxKt, P-Q5, etc.

          <p>The intention is to double Rooks and to force an entry at B7. P-

          <p>Curiously enough there is nothing better. Q-B2 only leads to the
            exchange of Queens and the same end-game, which, however, is an
            easy win for Black, as the permanent mating threat keeps the
            White Rook tied to the first rank, whilst the Black King
            threatens to capture all the White pawns.</p>
          <p>If Q-B2 White forces the exchange of Queens with the following
            combination: 41. Q-Q2, R-B7; 42. Q-Q3, R-B8ch; 43. K-Kt2, with a
            threat of Kt-B6ch and Q-R7 mate. Black therefore would have to

          <h5> 10. Q-Q2</h5>
          <p>White cannot win the QP by 10. PxP, PxP; 11. KtxP, KtxKt; 12.
            QxKt, because BxPch wins the Queen. The text move is played with
            the intention of bringing up the QR for the attack on the QP.
            However, it would have been more correct to fix the object of
            attack first by PxP, as Black could now cross White&rsquo;s intentions
            by playing PxP, after which he would sooner or later gain a move
            by occupying the Q file with a Rook, and forcing the White Queen
            to retreat.</p>
          <h5> 10. … Q-K2!</h5>
          <p>Black offers to give up his Queen&rsquo;s Pawn. If White accepts the
            sacrifice, Black&rsquo;s attack on the Queen&rsquo;s file will become deadly,
            as White must lose a move in bringing his Queen out of the line
            of action of the hostile Rook. The White King has then no time to
            get into safety, e.g. 11. PxP, PxP; 12. KtxP, KtxKt; 13. QxKt, R-
            Q1; 14. Q-Kt3, B-K3 followed by KtxP, etc.</p>
          <h5> 11. B-Q3?</h5>
          <p>Here again PxP (followed by B-K2, R-Q1, Castles) would have
            avoided the loss of a move, as indicated in my note to move 10.
            Now White loses yet another move, as Black exchanges pawns and
            the Bishop has taken two moves to reach B4, as against one only
            in the case of the Black KB. The loss of two moves in the
            opening stages should be fatal, and of this Rubinstein gives a
            striking example in the present game.</p>

            15. Castles KR Kt-K4</p>
          <p>The advantage which Black obtains by his last move is generally
            gained by White in this opening (compare Diag. 36). But in the
            game White has lost two moves and Black has assumed the
            offensive, having moreover a Rook acting on the Q file.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 12%; margin-right: 12%"> 16. KtxKt BxKt
            17. P-B4</p>
          <p>Black&rsquo;s threat was: BxPch followed by Q-Q3ch and QxB. If White
            replies: 17. KR-Q1 the answer is Q-B2 attacking both the RP and
            the Kt. The text move is unsatisfactory, as it will be necessary
            to advance the KP to K4 or K5, where it will block the diagonal
            of one of the Bishops.</p>

            fully makes up for its loss. But as played the Knight is driven
            from his dominating position, and the badly placed Bishop gets
            into play. No doubt even after the text move the ending is most
            difficult, and it requires Rubinstein&rsquo;s full powers to bring it

            KtxB would take too much time where time is all-important. White
            would clear the K side in the meantime, push on his KRP, and
            ultimately give up his R for Black&rsquo;s remaining P, as soon as the
            latter runs into Queen, after which the three passed pawns win
            easily against the Rook. Generally speaking it is wise, in R
            endings like the present one, to advance pawns on the side where
            there is an extra pawn, in order to get a passed pawn as soon as
            possible. Then the hostile Rook has to look after that pawn lest
            it should queen, and the greater mobility of one&rsquo;s own Rook often
            saves the game even when opposed by a preponderance of pawns.</p>

          <p>The most natural move to which the development of the QKt at Q2

            11. Kt-K5 Black could not yet attempt 11. … PxQP; 12. KPxP, B-

            give White chances of attack on the long diagonal QR1-KR8, White
            gives up two clear moves. Black is able to get considerably ahead

            have been the best plan, thus: Q-K2, KR-Q1, Kt-B1-Kt3. The text
            move is a preliminary to operations on the Queen&rsquo;s side, but

          <p>Black&rsquo;s difficulty is the development of his QB, particularly
            after White&rsquo;s last move, which prevents P-K4. If now Q-B2 White
            plays 9. P-K4 and either the Queen or the Knight bear on K5, e.g.
            9. … PxKP; 10. KtxP, P-K4; 11. QKt-Kt5, B-Q3; 12. P-B5, etc.</p>
          <p>Black therefore must develop his QB at Kt2 with P-QKt3, B-Kt2 and
            P-B4. Having moved the QBP twice, Black is a move behind the
            development usual in this opening. However, it would have been
            the lesser evil. In the present game the Bishop does not get into
            play in time.</p>

          <p>If Black captures the pawn, White gains time by threatening the
            Queen, and brings all his forces into play, whilst the Black
            Queen&rsquo;s side remains undeveloped, e.g.: 12. … QxP; 13. R-Q1,
            Q-B4; 14. Kt-Kt4, P-Kt3; 15. B-K3, Q-R4; 16. R-B1, with a strong
            attack. Black of course need not take the pawn, but the move in
            the text is a valuable one nevertheless, as the threat Q-B3-R3
            provokes a weakening pawn move.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 12. … P-Kt3

            15. QR-B1 B-Q2
            16. Q-Q2 Kt-Kt1</p>
          <p>It should be noted how the weakness at KR3 acts to the detriment
            of Black&rsquo;s game. The text move covers the weak square, but at the
            same time brings the Kt out of play. White in consequence gets
            the upper-hand on the Queen&rsquo;s side, and the Knight cannot return
            in time.</p>
          <p> 17. BxB QxB</p>
          <p>It would be no use taking with the KKt, as the threat Kt-Kt4 and
            Q-R6 must be guarded against. If the other Kt captures there
            follows: 18. B-K4, R-Kt1; 19. R-B3 and KR-B1.</p>
          <p> 18. B-K4 B-Kt4</p>
          <p>This drives the Rook to a better square, but already now there is
            no satisfactory move. It would perhaps have been best to parry
            the threat of BxKt and R-B7 by playing Q-Q3, although the pawn
            would have to recapture after 19. BxKt, because of 20. R-B5 and
            KR-B1. The chance of bearing on the QP through the open file,
            which was probably Black&rsquo;s intention all along, would then be
            lost. After the text move, however, White takes possession of the
            seventh rank, and Black&rsquo;s game collapses quickly.</p>

          <p>The system of opening chosen by Black has been tried frequently
            of late. It seems to be somewhat artificial, as the QB Pawn takes
            two moves to get to his fourth. On the other hand the pawn
            formation at QR3, QKt4, and QB4 is attained, whilst it can be
            prevented in other variations, e.g. 6. … Castles; 7. B-Q3, PxP;
            8. BxP, P-QR3; 9 P-QR4.</p>

          <p>Black&rsquo;s only plausible move here seems to be P-B4, and many
            critics have remarked that after 11. P-K5, PxP!; 12. Kt-K4 (if

            the game would have been even. However, this is not the case, for
            on the 15th move White does not capture the pawn with the Q but
            with the Kt and Black has no satisfactory continuation. If he had
            castled he could play l5. … B-Kt2 which now is not available
            because of: 16. Kt-B6, BxKt; 17. BxB, with an overwhelming
            advantage in position for White. White&rsquo;s refutation of the text
            move is above criticism.</p>

          <p>Again KtxP is not feasible on account of the loss of the QBP, as
            can be easily seen.</p>
          <p> 15. B-Kt3 PxP</p>
          <p>Black&rsquo;s game cannot be saved. If l5. … Kt(Kt5)xKP there follows

          <p> 16. P-Kt4!</p>
          <p>Now White initiates a brilliant attack, driving it home without
            giving Black a moment&rsquo;s rest. If Black takes the pawn, White
            plays Kt-Q4, with many threats, e.g. P-B4; 18. Kt-Q5, Q-Q3; 19.

          <p>The sacrifice is fairly obvious, as White obtains three pawns for
            the piece, and moreover drives the King into the field of battle.
            However, this does not detract from the beauty of the game, which

          <p>We have seen on page 55 that Black can hardly develop his QB
            without disadvantage. White, however, has no difficulty in doing
            so, as his QP is protected, and after Black&rsquo;s Q-Kt3 he has only
            to look after his KtP. He could play Q-B1, which might bring the
            Q into effective action on the diagonal to R6.</p>
          <p>The aim of the text move is the early occupation of K5. But, as
            the present game shows, this cannot be effected. Black must not
            waste time with Q-Kt3, but play B-Q3 at once.</p>

          <p>Now White has no means of maintaining his centre. Whether he
            supports the pawn with Kt-B3 or P-KB4, Black forces matters with

          <p>Now that the idea underlying White&rsquo;s opening strategy has proved
            impracticable, he has difficulty in formulating a plan. Making
            the best of a bad job, he abandons his KP in exchange for Black&rsquo;s
            KRP. But Black obtains a powerful pawn centre, a telling
            advantage.</p>

            18. P-QB4, P-Q5). In order to avoid this continuation, White
            takes his chance of castling on the Queen&rsquo;s side. This turns out
            to Black&rsquo;s advantage. Indeed it is a foregone conclusion. In the
            ensuing double assault by pawns, Black is several moves ahead, as
            the White pawns concerned in the attack are still on their

          <p>Irregular Opening.</p>
          <h5>1. P-Q4 P-QB4</h5>
          <p>With this move Black tries to avoid well-trodden paths of
            tournament practice. White can, at will, lead into a peaceful
            Queen&rsquo;s Gambit by 2. P-K3 or into a Sicilian Defence by P-K4. It
            is more usual, however, to play P-Q5, which blocks up the Black
            centre to some extent.</p>
          <p>If 2. PxP, Black regains his pawn after P-K3 without any
            disadvantage.</p>
          <h5> 2. P-Q5 P-Q3
            3. P-QB4</h5>
          <p>Coupled with 4. P-K4, this move is of doubtful value, as Black
            gains command of White&rsquo;s Q4. It is advisable to keep the QBP
            back, thus retaining the option of driving off a hostile piece
            from Q4 by P-QB3. Moreover, the White KB is hemmed in by the pawn
            at QB4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%"> 3. … P-KKt3
            4. P-K4 B-Kt2
            5. B-Q3 P-K3</p>
          <p>The development of the KKt is not desirable at B3, where it would
            block the long diagonal. From K2, however, it commands KB4, where
            it can take up a strong position after the exchange of pawns in
            the centre, or else it can support the advance of the KBP.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 15%; margin-right: 15%"> 6. Kt-QB3 Kt-K2
            7. KKt-K2</p>
          <p>Kt-B3 would have been slightly better, because the Black QKt
            might play to his K4.</p>

            8. KPxP Kt-Q2
            9. P-B4</p>
          <p>This move weakens the King&rsquo;s position, and would be justified
            only if there was a possibility of opening the file for the Rook
            by P-B5. But Black has too strong a hold on his KB4. The text
            move aims at preventing the exchange of White&rsquo;s KB through
            Black&rsquo;s Kt-K4. It would have been better to withdraw the B to B2.</p>

            10. Kt-Kt3 P-KR4!</p>
          <p>Now White cannot enforce P-B5, as Black can attack the Knight by
            P-R5. White cannot prevent this with P-KR4, as the Black Knight
            would take up a commanding position at Kt5. Black&rsquo;s game is
            superior. He can concentrate all his minor pieces on the King&rsquo;s
            wing, while White&rsquo;s QB is ineffective on account of the ill-
            considered advance of the KBP.</p>

            and Black would only have castled on the Queen&rsquo;s side if at all.</p>
          <h5> 17. Q-B3</h5>
          <p>Here P-KR3 was essential in order to prevent the further advance
            of the KRP. The weakness at Kt3 would not have been so serious in
            the absence of a Black Knight. Now Black forces the advance of
            White&rsquo;s KKtP, and the Bishops become immediately effective.</p>

          <p>There is no answer to Black&rsquo;s threat of doubling the Rooks on the
            K file. If White plays Q-B2, Black&rsquo;s Queen effects an entry at
            Q6, after which he would double his Rooks, and White&rsquo;s Bishop
            cannot be defended. After the text move, Black forces the
            exchange of his two Rooks for the Queen. Generally speaking, this
            is no disadvantage, but in consequence of the exposed position of
            the White King, it means a speedy loss for White.</p>

          <p>4. Kt-KB3, P-KKt4; 5. P-Q4, P-Kt5; 6. Kt-K5, Kt-QB3; 7. KtxKt,
            PxKt; 8. P-KKt3, P-KR4; 9. B-Kt2, P-R5; 10. Q-Q3, B-Q2; 11. Kt-
            B3, R-Kt1; 12. Castles, PxP; 13. PxP, P-QB4; 14. B-B4, BxB; 15.
            RxB, Q-Kt4; 16. Kt-K4, Q-R3; 17. KtxP, Kt-B3; 18. KtxB, KtxKt;

            Resigns.</p>
          <p>When Black plays P-KB4 in answer to 1. P-Q4 we have the Dutch
            Defence. After 1. P-Q4, P-KB4, White can also sacrifice a pawn by
            2. P-K4, and thereby obtain a far more favourable position than
            Black does in From&rsquo;s gambit, as he is a move to the good, having
            already advanced his QP, e.g. 2. P-K4, PxP; 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3; 4.
            P-B3 or 4. B-Kt5 and then P-B3. If Black captures the KBP, White
            obtains a powerful attack. A drastic example is found in the
            following little game, played by two students in an academic
            tournament at Petrograd: 4. P-B3, PxP; 5. KtxP, P-K3; 6. B-KKt5,
            B-K2; 7. B-Q3, Castles; 8. Castles, P-QKt3; 9. Kt-K5, B-Kt2; 10.
            BxKt, BxB; 11. BxPch, KxB; 12. Q-R5ch, K-Kt1; 13. Kt-Kt6, R-K1;
            14. Q-R8ch, K-B2; 15. Kt-K5ch, K-K2; 16. QxPch!!, BxQ; 17. R-
            B7ch, K-Q3; 18. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Q4; 19. P-B4ch, K-K5; 20. R-K1 mate.</p>
          <p>Black&rsquo;s best answer is to play P-Q4 after White&rsquo;s 4. P-KB3 (5.
            B-Kt5, B-B4). If 4. B-Kt5, it is not yet possible to play P-Q4
            because of the threat: BxKt, Q-R5ch, and QxQP. In that case Black
            must first play P-QB3, after which White again obtains a strong
            attack by P-KB3.</p>
          <p>Black can avoid the attacks which follow after 1. P-Q4, P-KB4; 2.
            P-K4, by playing P-K3 on his first move, and then lead into the
            Dutch defence with P-KB4 on his second move. He must, however,
            reckon with having to play the French defence which White can
            bring about with 2. P-K4.</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 13%; margin-right: 13%"> 2. P-K3 P-K3

            4. P-QKt3 Kt-QB3
            5. B-Kt5 Kt-B3</p>
          <p>Black should have played B-Q2 here, as White can exchange at B6,
            leaving Black with a doubled pawn. This in itself is not a
            drawback, but in the present position it is serious, as Black
            will have difficulty in finding a place for his QB. For there is
            no prospect of enforcing P-K4, as White commands that square in
            sufficient force.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Black&rsquo;s attempt of capturing his K4 by playing Kt-Q2 and P-B3,
            White would cross at once with Q-Kt4. With the text move Black
            begins operations on the Q side, which is quite correct, as White
            has the upper hand on the other wing.</p>
          <h5> 11. Q-K2</h5>
          <p>White should have prevented the further advance of the Black RP
            by 11. P-QR4. This would have been sound policy in any case, as
            the R file could not have been forced open for the Black Rooks.</p>

            12. Kt-Q2 PxP</p>
          <p>Premature. The capture is only of value if the file can be held.
            To that end it is first necessary to play B-Kt2 and to occupy the
            R file with Rooks and Queen. After the exchange
            of Rooks, Black is at a disadvantage for the end-game because of
            the inefficiency of the QB.</p>

          <p>If instead of the text move Black had driven off the Bishop to B1
            with P-R6 (13. B-B3?, P-Q5!; 14. PxP, Kt-Q4) he could have
            enforced his P-K4, but in the long run White would have captured
            the QRP, and remained with a passed pawn on the R file, a
            powerful weapon for the end-game, e.g. l2. … P-R6; 13. B-B1,
            Kt-Q2; 14. KtxKt, BxKt; 15. P-K4, P-KB3; 16. P-B4, followed by

            constant threat of establishing his Kt there and of capturing the
            RP.</p>
          <h5> 25. K-B1</h5>
          <p>This move is superfluous and probably dictated by time pressure.
            The proper plan is: Q-QKt2 with the threat of B-B7 or Kt8 and Q-
            R8ch.

            Black must keep his B at K2 and his K must remain near the KBP.
            White&rsquo;s King marches to QKt6 and captures the QB pawns, queening
            his QKtP. Black cannot prevent the White King from doing this by

          <p>White: Blackburne. Black: Niemzowitsch.</p>
          <p>Irregular Opening.</p>
          <h5>1. P-K3 P-Q3</h5>
          <p>It is due to this reply of Black&rsquo;s that the opening is irregular.
            For had he played P-Q4 a peaceful QP game would have resulted, or
            after White&rsquo;s 2. P-KB4 a Dutch opening.</p>

            3. PxP PxP</p>
          <p>Black has the superior position; he has a pawn in the centre and
            his pieces are more free.</p>
          <p> 4. Kt-QB3 B-Q3</p>
          <p>As was seen on a former occasion, it is a shade better to develop
            the Knights before the Bishops, as the choice of moves for the
            latter is less limited. The alternative might have been 5. Kt-B3,
            B-KKt5; 6. B-K2, Kt-B3.</p>
          <h5> 5. P-K4</h5>
          <p>Now White has also a pawn in the centre, but he is a move behind
            in his development.</p>

          <p>Now Black has gained an advantage from the command of his Q5. The
            advance of White&rsquo;s QBP, which was necessitated by the dominating
            position of the Black Knight, has left White with a &ldquo;backward&rdquo;

          <p> 15. Kt-R4</p>
          <p>White&rsquo;s counter attack on the King&rsquo;s side becomes threatening,
            and Black must continue his operations on the Queen&rsquo;s wing with
            the greatest care, as he may be called upon at any time to

            which is made possible by the weakness of White&rsquo;s QP, Black
            should look after his King&rsquo;s side, where White has collected an
            alarming array of forces. After the text move the Rook is quite

          <p>White obtains a Rook and two pawns for his two Knights; this is
            in itself an equivalent of material. In the present instance the
            exchange is of decisive advantage for White, as Black must lose
            several moves to bring up his Rook for the defence of his

          States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the

          claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
          displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as

          that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting

          works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the

          assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
          goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
          remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
          Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
          and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
          generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
          Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
          Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

          Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
        </div>
        <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
          Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
          public support and donations to carry out its mission of
          increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
          freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
          array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
          ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
          status with the IRS.
        </div>
        <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
          The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
          charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
          States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
          considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
          with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
          where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
          DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
          visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
        </div>
        <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
          While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
          have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
          against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
          approach us with offers to donate.
        </div>
        <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
          International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
          any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
          outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
        </div>
        <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
          Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
          methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
          ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

          Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
        </div>
        <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
          Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
          Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
          freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
          distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
          volunteer support.
        </div>
        <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
          Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
          editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
          the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
          necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
          edition.
